GOALS OF THE CONTEST:

     To write the most ObscureObfuscated C program under the rules below.
     To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
     To stress C compilers with unusual code.
     To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
     To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :)


RULES:

    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:

    1) Your entry must be a complete program.

    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
       ecluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and ecluding any ; { or }
       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.

    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:

entry
rule:	1993
fi:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
title:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
entry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
date:	Datetime of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
host:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
	Use tab indented lines if needed
remark
    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
author
name:	your name
org:	SchoolCompanyOrganization
addr:	postal address
	use tab indented lines to continue
	don't forget to include the country
email:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
anon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
info
If your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
this section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
sections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
build
Place a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compilebuild your program
in this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
file must be 255 bytes or less.
program
Place a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
into a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule 2.
end

      Regarding the above format:

	 The title must match the epression: [azAZ09_=][azAZ09_=+]
	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.

	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.

	 The date in the entry section should be given with respect
	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)

	 You may correctrevise a previously submitted entry by sending
	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fi' in the 
	  entry section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the remark as well.

	 With the eception of the header, all tet outside of the above 
	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
	  something, put it in the remark section, or send a separate
	  Email message to the judges.

	 Information from the author section will be published unless 
	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.

	 To credit multiple authors, include an author section for
	  each author.  Each should start with author line, and
	  should be found between the entry and build sections.

	 The entry's remarks should include:
	     what this program does
	     how to run the program (sample args or input)
	     special compile or eecution instructions, if any
	     special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
	     information about any data files
	     why you think the program is obfuscated
	     note if this entry is a resubmission of a previous entry.
	     any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)

	 Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.

         Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
	  should not be required to eist.

	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the info
	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
	  info sections, one per info file.  You should describe
	  each info file in the remark section.

    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:

	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
	       digit, followed by '.c'
	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
	       title, possibly followed by a digit

       If your entry requires that a build file eist, state so in your
       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to eecute a
       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.

       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.

    5) The build file, the source and the resulting eecutable should be
       treated as readonly files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.

    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
       Use of common C (K&R + etensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.

    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.

    8) Entries must be received prior to 07May93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:

		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
		obfuscate@toad.com

       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.

       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
       until 1Mar93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
       all entries received after 1Mar93 0:00 UTC.

    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
       must be sent in a separate Email letter.

   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be eecuted.

   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, superuser,
       special owner or group) are not allowed.

10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments

Copyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.  
All Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or nonprofit use is 
granted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety 
and remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing 
from both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.

ABOUT THIS FILE:

    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).

    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.

    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.


WHAT IS NEW IN 1993:

    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.

    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
    nonintegral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
    directives and the eit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.


HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:

    You are encouraged to eamine the winners of previous contests.  See
    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.

    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
    might be 'old' the net year.

    An entry is usually eamined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
    a number of tests to an entry:

	 look at the original source
	 convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII
	 C preprocess the source ignoring 'include' lines
	 C preprocess the source ignoring 'define' and 'include' lines
	 run it through a C beautifier
	 eamine the algorithm
	 lint it
	 compile it
	 eecute it

    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
    'cleaned up' by the C preprocessor and a C beautifier.

    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
    'strangestmost creative source layout' need not do as well as
    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
    does something interesting when you run it.

    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.

    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
    annoy more than amuse.

    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
    to attempt to eploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
    and then plug the hole net year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :)

    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.

    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
    a strange bugfeature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
    working entry is best.


OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:

    Doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
    tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests
    that we apply.  Simply abusing defines or Dfoo=bar won't go as far
    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.

    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:

	define d define
	d foo		   < don't epect this to turn into define foo

	int i;
	j;		   < don't use such implicit type declaration
	int k;

    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
    must use nonANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
    compilelink errors for ANSI C compilers.

    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indees to be of integral type.
    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:

	int i;
	char c;
	i[c];		   < use c[i] instead
	(i+3)[""string""];   < use ""string""[i+3] instead

    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
    not portable and must not be used:

	 assigning a nonva_list variable tofrom a va_list variable
	 casting a nonva_list variable intofrom a va_list variable
	 passing a va_list variable to a function epecting a nonva_list arg
	 passing a nonva_list variable to a function epecting a va_list arg
	 performing arithmetic on va_list variables
	 using va_list as a structure or union

    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char 's.

    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.

    If you use C preprocessor directives (define, if, ifdef, ...),
    the leading '' must be the first character on a line.  While some
    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '', many do not.

    Because the eit() function returns void on some systems, entries
    must not assume that it returns an int.

    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
    While such programs are not as comple as other winners, they do
    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
    programs that are compact, and are instructional.

    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.

    We tend to dislike programs that:

	 are very hardware specific
	 are very OS or Un version specific
	     (indestrchr differences are ok, but socketstreams specific
	      code is likely not to be)
	 dump core or have compiler warnings
	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
	 won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un
	 abusing the build file to get around the size limit
	 obfuscate by ecessive use of ANSI trigraphs
	 are longer than they need to be
	 are similar to previous winners
	 are identical to previous losers  :)

    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
    in a more creative way than simply forming ecessively long lines.

    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several D's to help out,
    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of D's in order to
    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
    if you show some amount of restraint.

    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.

    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
    andor obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!

    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest selfreplicating'
    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with selfreplicating
    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been selfreplicating.
    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
    know of a smaller one!

     client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
    depend on a particular type of display.  For eample, don't depend
    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.

     client entries should avoid using  related libraries and
    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such  client
    entries restrict themselves to only the low level lib and the
    Athena widget set (lib11.a, libaw.a, libmu.a and libt.a).
    Don't use Mtif, vew, or OpenLok toolkits, since not everyone
    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
    everyone has 11r5, and some people are stuck back in 11r4 (or
    earlier), so try to target 11r5 without requiring 11r5.  Better
    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11  Window Systems.

     client entries should not to depend on particular items on
    .defaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
    in the remark section.

    We like programs that:

	 are as concise and small as they need to be
	 do something at least quasiinteresting
	 pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
	 are portable
	 are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
	 MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
	 make us laugh andor throw up  :)

    Some types of programs can't ecel in some areas.  Of course, your
    program doesn't have to ecel in all areas, but doing well in several
    areas really does help.

    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
    the remark section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.

    Be creative!


ENTRY FORMAT:

    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)

    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an eample of how to
    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
    is found in mkentry.c:

	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
	contest rules before submitting an entry.

    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
    the entry against the size rules.

    If you have any suggestions, comments, fies or complaints about
    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)

    The following is a sample entry:

entry
rule:	1993
fi:	n
title:	chonglab
entry:	0
date:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
host:	Un v6, pdp1145
	2.9BSD, pdp1170
remark
    This is a nonobfuscated obfuscated C program.

    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you epect from
    a short eample!

    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
    digit in case of name conflicts.

    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.

    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
    andor binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
    remark section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
    if you did one of the following:

	 Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.

	 Have the build file make copies of the files.  For eample:

		cc prog.c o special_name		need special binary

	    or  rm f special_src.c			need special source
		cp prog.c special_src.c
		cc special_src.c o special_name

	    or  rm f special_build			need special build
		tail +4 build > special_build
		sh < special_build

	 Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
	  your buildprogram files that uses the name convention.  You 
	  should uuencode these files in data sections.

    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
    please say so in the remark section.  You should try to avoid
    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch.

    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
    build file must eist, say so in the remark section.

    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
    into info sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
    use multiple info sections.  If no info files are needed,
    then skip the info section.

    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
    does not fit well into the remark section.  For eample, an
    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
    'hints' file.

    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
    eample, info files may provide sample input or detailed
    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
    the entry should not require them eist.

    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
    say so in the remark section.

    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a subdirectory, say
    so in the remark section.

    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
    have entry number 0.

    With the eception of the header, all tet outside of the entry
    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place tet outside of the
    entry and epect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
    remark section, or send a Email to the judges at:

	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
    
    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An eample of such a string is:

	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993

    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:

	date u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""
	date u | sed e 's... (19[09][09])$1'
	sh c 'TZ=UTC date | sed e ""s... (19[09][09])$1""'
	sh c 'TZ=GMT date | sed e ""s... (19[09][09])$1""'
	sh c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed e ""s... (19[09][09])$1""'

    You are allowed to updatefirevise your entry.  To do so, set
    the 'fi' line in the entry section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
    replaced.


JUDGING PROCESS:

    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.

    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:

	entry section
	all author sections
	all info sections
	build section
	program section
	any other tet, including the Email message headers

    Prior to judging, the 'any other tet' file is scanned to be sure
    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
    author sections are not read until the judging process is
    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.

    The above process helps keep us biased foragainst any one particular
    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
    out in the end, who won and where they were from.

    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion.  We remove all nonwinning
    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
    winners at talks)

    After the Useni announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
    often accept their suggestionscomments about our remarks as well.
    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.

    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
    the pile that advances on to the net round, and the pile that does
    not.  We also reeamine the entries that were eliminated in the
    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.

    A reading consists of a number of actions:

	 reading the entry section
	 reading the uudecoded build section
	 reading the uudecoded program section
	 reading the uudecoded info section(s), if any
	 passing the source thru the C preprocessor
	    shipping over any include files
	 performing a number of C beautifycleanup edits on the source
	 passing the beautified source thru the C preprocessor
	    shipping over any include files

    In later rounds, other actions are performed:

	 linting the source
	 compilingbuilding the source
	 running the program
	 performing misc tests on the source and binary

    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
    An entry often will compete in several categories.

    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
    we receive.  A typical category list might be:

	 best small one line program
	 best small program
	 strangestmost creative source layout
	 most useful obfuscated program
	 best game that is obfuscated
	 most creatively obfuscated program
	 most deceptive C code
	 best  client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
	 best abuse of ANSI C
	 worst abuse of the rules
	 <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>

    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For eample, a few entries are so
    goodbad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.

    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
    less clear cut.

    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry 
    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!

    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
    strangecreative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
    rules in some way.

    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
    an entry simply far eceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.


ANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:

    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Useni conference.  By tradition,
    this is done during the latter part of the UUNETIOCCC BOF, just prior to
    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.

    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:

	    comp.lang.c		  comp.uni.wizards	alt.sources

    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following

	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.

    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
    below for details.

    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on TShirts.

    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :)

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)
=====================================================================

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?

1. Free options
	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.
	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will
	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86
	is listed below.

	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was
	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.
	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,
	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).
	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?

3. What is XFree86?

   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with
   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:

    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,
       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of
       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield
       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.
    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately
       20% faster than X386 1.2.
    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,
       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from
       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.
    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.
       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers.
    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is
       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the
       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions.
    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.
    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included.

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2
   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):

    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 
       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).
    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a ""two
       headed"" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).
    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to
       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for
       more information.)
    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation).
    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       information).
    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.
    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file).

       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details.

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the
   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.

4. What OSs are supported?

    XFree86 supports:
	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2
	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC
	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2
	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1

	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active
	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.

	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to
	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. What video hardware is supported?

   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:

	Tseng ET4000
	Tseng ET3000
	Paradise PVGA1
	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of
		the PVGA1, and use its driver)
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000
	ATI 18800, 28800

	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in
	256 color mode.

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the
	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86
	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how
	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such
	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree86 releases.

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,
	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not
	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.
	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.

	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It
	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested
	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86
	working fine on them.

6. What about accelerated boards?

	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards
	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).

	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact
	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.

	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.

7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-
	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled
	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code
	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).
	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer
	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,
	but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?

	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run
	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.
	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending
	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will
	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound.

9. Where can I get source for XFree86?

	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22
	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:
		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

			under /i386

	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were
	made when building the distribution.

IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?

11. Installation directories

	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include
	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is
	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed
	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.

12. Configuration files

	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (""Xconfig"") on startup.
	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.
	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and
	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is
	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on
	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated
	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the
	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database.

	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 
	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use
	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and
	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future.

14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.

V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?

	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).

15. SVR4
	Why won't my xterm run properly?

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define
	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. SVR3

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.

17. 386BSD

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.

	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:

	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2

18. Linux

	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump libraries installed.

	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to
	run the server as ""X -pn"". The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files
	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the
	-pn argument to X386.

	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major
	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not
	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but
	startx won't.

	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with
	a tty, for example ""xdm < /dev/console &"".

	For more detailed information, please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. Mach

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.

VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?

	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is
	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.

VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?

20. BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a
	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),
	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a

21. ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONS=""-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings""
	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""
	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONS=""-ansi""
		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:
		ANSICCOPTIONS=
	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death
	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

XFree86 Contact Information

    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86
    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:

0.  Xt Glossary
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code
  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with
  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,
  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,
  etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,
  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X
  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,
  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the
  Intrinsics are not especially useful.

o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The
  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It
  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless
  widgets or gadgets.

o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below
  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib
  functions because Xt provides most such services although an
  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a
list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem
specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.

The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop
about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.

Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.

        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has
three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and
border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap
resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these
resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the
shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen
and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is
not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is
created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.  

How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information.",windows

I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell 
you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE.  In TeleUSE you can call any
C++ method from a ""D"" module.  What you can do then is to use the ""D"" language
for most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code.

I should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon
in regard to C++, but I can't give you many details.  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.

If you want example code of how C++ integrates with TeleUSE you should look at

Hi, 

I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
DrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In
particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some
XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on
some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the
pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.

Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server
bug?

Thanks,

Zack T. Smith

I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not

I have an X/Motif application that I have written.
I have a couple of gif files (or pict) that I have
scanned in with a color scanner.  Now I would like
to be able to convert the gif files into a format
that could be read into my application and displayed

pixmaps, or perhaps as an XImage.

I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite

I really do need color.

I have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writes
out several formats, but have not found a way to write
out a file which can be read in as a pixmap.

Is there an easy way to do this?

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge).  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry 
about these changes.

NOTE: Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  >	      |


RULES:

    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:

    1) Your entry must be a complete program.

    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
       ecluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and ecluding any ; { or }
       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.

    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:

entry
rule:	1993
fi:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
title:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
entry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
date:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
host:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
	Use tab indented lines if needed
remark
    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
author
name:	your name
org:	School/Company/Organization
addr:	postal address
	use tab indented lines to continue
	don't forget to include the country
email:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
anon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
info
If your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
this section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
sections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
build
Place a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
in this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
file must be 255 bytes or less.
program
Place a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
into a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule 2.
end

      Regarding the above format:

	* The title must match the epression: [azAZ09_=][azAZ09_=+]*
	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.

	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.

	* The date in the entry section should be given with respect
	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()
	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)

	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fi' in the
	  entry section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same
	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be
	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the remark as well.

	* With the eception of the header, all tet outside of the above
	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
	  something, put it in the remark section, or send a separate
	  Email message to the judges.

	* Information from the author section will be published unless
	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.

	* To credit multiple authors, include an author section for
	  each author.  Each should start with author line, and
	  should be found between the entry and build sections.

	* The entry's remarks should include:
	     what this program does
	     how to run the program (sample args or input)
	     special compile or eecution instructions, if any
	     special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
	     information about any data files
	     why you think the program is obfuscated
	     note if this entry is a resubmission of a previous entry.
	     any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)

	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.

        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They
	  should not be required to eist.

	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the info
	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple
	  info sections, one per info file.  You should describe
	  each info file in the remark section.

    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:

	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
	       digit, followed by '.c'
	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
	       title, possibly followed by a digit

       If your entry requires that a build file eist, state so in your
       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to eecute a
       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.

       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.

    5) The build file, the source and the resulting eecutable should be
       treated as readonly files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.

    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
       Use of common C (K&R + etensions) is permitted, as long as it does not
       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.

    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.

    8) Entries must be received prior to 07May93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:

		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
		obfuscate@toad.com

       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.

       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
       until 1Mar93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
       all entries received after 1Mar93 0:00 UTC.

    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
       must be sent in a separate Email letter.

   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.
       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be eecuted.

   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, superuser,
       special owner or group) are not allowed.

10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments

ABOUT THIS FILE:

    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).

    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.

    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.

    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  >		      |


WHAT IS NEW IN 1993:

    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.

    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers
    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with
    nonintegral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor
    directives and the eit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.


HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:

    You are encouraged to eamine the winners of previous contests.  See
    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.

    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
    might be 'old' the net year.

    An entry is usually eamined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
    a number of tests to an entry:

	* look at the original source
	* convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII
	* C preprocess the source ignoring 'include' lines
	* C preprocess the source ignoring 'define' and 'include' lines
	* run it through a C beautifier
	* eamine the algorithm
	* lint it
	* compile it
	* eecute it

    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
    'cleaned up' by the C preprocessor and a C beautifier.

    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
    does something interesting when you run it.

    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.

    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
    annoy more than amuse.

    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
    to attempt to eploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
    and then plug the hole net year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :)

    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.

    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
    working entry is best.


OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:

    Doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
    tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our preprocessor tests
    that we apply.  Simply abusing defines or Dfoo=bar won't go as far
    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.

    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:

	define d define
	d foo		   < don't epect this to turn into define foo

	int i;
	j;		   < don't use such implicit type declaration
	int k;

    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you
    must use nonANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in
    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.

    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indees to be of       |
    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |
    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaed in future contests.	      |

	int i;
	char *c;
	i[c];		   < use c[i] instead
	(i+3)[""string""];   < use ""string""[i+3] instead

    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
    not portable and must not be used:

	* assigning a nonva_list variable to/from a va_list variable
	* casting a nonva_list variable into/from a va_list variable
	* passing a va_list variable to a function epecting a nonva_list arg
	* passing a nonva_list variable to a function epecting a va_list arg
	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
	* using va_list as a structure or union

    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.

    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.

    If you use C preprocessor directives (define, if, ifdef, ...),
    the leading '' must be the first character on a line.  While some
    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '', many do not.

    Because the eit() function returns void on some systems, entries
    must not assume that it returns an int.

    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
    While such programs are not as comple as other winners, they do
    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
    programs that are compact, and are instructional.

    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.

    We tend to dislike programs that:

	* are very hardware specific
	* are very OS or Un* version specific
	     (inde/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
	      code is likely not to be)
	* dump core or have compiler warnings
	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*
	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
	* obfuscate by ecessive use of ANSI trigraphs
	* are longer than they need to be
	* are similar to previous winners
	* are identical to previous losers  :)

    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
    in a more creative way than simply forming ecessively long lines.

    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several D's to help out,
    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of D's in order to
    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
    if you show some amount of restraint.

    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.

    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!

    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest selfreplicating'
    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with selfreplicating
    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been selfreplicating.
    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
    know of a smaller one!

     client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
    depend on a particular type of display.  For eample, don't depend
    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.

     client entries should avoid using  related libraries and
    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such  client
    entries restrict themselves to only the low level lib and the
    Athena widget set (lib11.a, libaw.a, libmu.a and libt.a).
    Don't use M*tif, v*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
    everyone has 11r5, and some people are stuck back in 11r4 (or
    earlier), so try to target 11r5 without requiring 11r5.  Better
    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11  Window Systems.

     client entries should not to depend on particular items on
    .defaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
    in the remark section.

    We like programs that:

	* are as concise and small as they need to be
	* do something at least quasiinteresting
	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
	* are portable
	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :)

    Some types of programs can't ecel in some areas.  Of course, your
    program doesn't have to ecel in all areas, but doing well in several
    areas really does help.

    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
    the remark section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.

    Be creative!


ENTRY FORMAT:

    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)

    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an eample of how to
    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
    is found in mkentry.c:

	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
	contest rules before submitting an entry.

    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
    the entry against the size rules.

    If you have any suggestions, comments, fies or complaints about
    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)

    The following is a sample entry:

entry
rule:	1993
fi:	n
title:	chonglab
entry:	0
date:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
host:	Un* v6, pdp11/45
	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
remark
    This is a nonobfuscated obfuscated C program.

    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you epect from
    a short eample!

    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
    digit in case of name conflicts.

    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.

    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
    remark section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
    if you did one of the following:

	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.

	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For eample:

		cc prog.c o special_name		need special binary

	    or  rm f special_src.c			need special source
		cp prog.c special_src.c
		cc special_src.c o special_name

	    or  rm f special_build			need special build
		tail +4 build > special_build
		sh < special_build

	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of
	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You
	  should uuencode these files in data sections.

    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
    please say so in the remark section.  You should try to avoid
    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
    will allow people to regenerate your entry from scratch.

    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
    build file must eist, say so in the remark section.

    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
    into info sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
    use multiple info sections.  If no info files are needed,
    then skip the info section.

    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
    does not fit well into the remark section.  For eample, an
    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
    'hints' file.

    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
    eample, info files may provide sample input or detailed
    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
    the entry should not require them eist.

    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
    say so in the remark section.

    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a subdirectory, say
    so in the remark section.

    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
    have entry number 0.

    With the eception of the header, all tet outside of the entry
    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place tet outside of the
    entry and epect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the
    remark section, or send a Email to the judges at:

	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)

    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer
    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as
    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An eample of such a string is:

	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993

    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many
    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:

	date u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""
	date u | sed e 's/... \(19[09][09]\)$1/'
	sh c 'TZ=UTC date | sed e ""s/... \(19[09][09]\)$1/""'
	sh c 'TZ=GMT date | sed e ""s/... \(19[09][09]\)$1/""'
	sh c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed e ""s/... \(19[09][09]\)$1/""'

    You are allowed to update/fi/revise your entry.  To do so, set
    the 'fi' line in the entry section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
    replaced.


JUDGING PROCESS:

    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.

    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:

	entry section
	all author sections
	all info sections
	build section
	program section
	any other tet, including the Email message headers

    Prior to judging, the 'any other tet' file is scanned to be sure
    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
    author sections are not read until the judging process is
    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.

    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
    out in the end, who won and where they were from.

    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
    attempts to send nonwinners into oblivion.  We remove all nonwinning
    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
    winners at talks)

    After the Useni announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.

    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
    the pile that advances on to the net round, and the pile that does
    not.  We also reeamine the entries that were eliminated in the
    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.

    A reading consists of a number of actions:

	* reading the entry section
	* reading the uudecoded build section
	* reading the uudecoded program section
	* reading the uudecoded info section(s), if any
	* passing the source thru the C preprocessor
	    shipping over any include files
	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
	* passing the beautified source thru the C preprocessor
	    shipping over any include files

    In later rounds, other actions are performed:

	* linting the source
	* compiling/building the source
	* running the program
	* performing misc tests on the source and binary

    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
    An entry often will compete in several categories.

    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
    we receive.  A typical category list might be:

	* best small one line program
	* best small program
	* strangest/most creative source layout
	* most useful obfuscated program
	* best game that is obfuscated
	* most creatively obfuscated program
	* most deceptive C code
	* best  client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
	* best abuse of ANSI C
	* worst abuse of the rules
	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>

    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For eample, a few entries are so
    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.

    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
    less clear cut.

    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
    sometimes worthwhile to reenter an improved version of an entry
    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,
    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!

    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
    rules in some way.",windows

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I
noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps
even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well
to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot
quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets
back into my long pulldown menus? 

XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network
type graph with automatic layout capability.

No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS.
It is not relevant for MIT R5. MIT R5 should compile without problems.

I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I
couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X, due out
last February :-) has full support for C++.

I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages
of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation,
reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated, a variety of
other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different
ways, and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop, 
internationalization, etc.).  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Young's
paradigm for C++/Motif.

You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap
(XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.  What you want
to do is start your application with your new colormap.  This can be a
chicken and egg sort of problem, however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ
there is an example that should show how it can be done.  If not, let
me know and maybe I can improve the example.

They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth
adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.

At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) 
start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects:
Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 
assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and 
Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group
discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).
The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company 
for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special 
Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  
The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering 
(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing 
Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where 
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
suddenly).
 
In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and 
exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 
30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework 
assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?

BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). 

Cheers,
  Michael

I would like to configure my system (a HP UNIX) to avoid that any corner

1. Can this be done by configuring the window manager's resources

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. However in your
event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
which button was pressed i.e.

void
SomeEventHandler(Widget w, XtPointer data, XEvent *event)
{
    /* Catch the button 1 (usually left button) */
    if ( event->xbutton.button == Button1 ) {
        /* do some action */
    } else {
        /* do nothing and exit from function */
    } 
}

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name ""opaque"" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this
bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to
adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.

But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it
is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,
and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

(please respond via email!)

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with
O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
(which makes no sense to me).

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So
you can't actually edit any colors.

We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail 
for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.

Any hints?

Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.
It's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.
Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
and some stuff about comms.   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and 
X Windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.

The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought
invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course.

Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window
manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root
window. 

Contact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code.

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members. The 1992.1 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a
table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG
members, including a caddy!

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,
almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net
postings, priced at only $250.

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a
SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
within the US or $55 outside.

The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543MB of material, including:

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0
distribution are included (109MB of material).  Binaries for: X Xsun

COPIES OF CONTRIBUTED X SOURCES (from export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib),
which were then uncompressed/untarred into source directories (212MB).
These are sources only, and some of them were (after the date of
production of this disk) included in the MIT contrib-2 and contrib-3
distributions.

GNU SOURCES WHICH WERE uncompressed/untarred into source directories
(88MB).

We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having
a problem with it. We have a graphics widget that we wrote to
display waveforms, and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons,
etc, all show up, and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to
draw, but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I
have no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine
on all our suns (3s and 4s, color and B&W). could anyone suggest a
line of attack for this problem?

TekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 6.0.0. host is a Sun IPX

Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function ""XmuCvtStringToWidget"". I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.

MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW

However, when I run the program, I get the message:

Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.

(Just like the manual sez).

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this:

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {
        {
            XtWidgetBaseOffset,
            (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),
            sizeof(CoreWidget)
        }
    };

    XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,

However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's ""class_intialize"" function. HOW? What's
one of those? :-(

If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure
this is a FAQ.

Thanks in advance,

Rik.

PS: What are the header files ""CoreP.h"" and ""IntrinsicsP.h"" - should I use
    these or ""Core.h"" and ""Intrinsics.h"" (OK I know RTFM:-)

I am trying to write an image display program that uses

But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage,
with the following message:

X Error of failed request:  BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter)

segment, as well as checking XShmAttach.  There are no
problems.

If anybody has had the same problem or has used MIT-SHM without

By the way, I am running OpenWindows 3.0 on a Sun Sparc2.

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode (so do some
screen-locks).  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.

Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory
leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() 
regularly.

What I like about GUI's:

	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,
	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way
	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...

	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible
	  and accessable at the same time.

	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with
	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.
	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do
	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and painful experience.


What I hate about GUI's:

	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess
	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a
	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my
	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be
	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,
	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I
	  need to use both hands for is entering text.

	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons
	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.

Hi,

xtici worked for my system.
I'm using X11R5 pl 17 clientside only on a DEC 5000/240 on Ultrix 4.3
May be you have a serious floatingpoint compilation problem ?

Subject: Books on I.C.C other than I.C.C.M.
Nntp-Posting-Host: nsidc2.colorado.edu

Lines: 21

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications
BESIDES I.C.C.M.?

I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples,
Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,
if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had
my applications talking to each other.

I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X
one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.

I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best
for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words.

Thanks in advance

Subject: How to disable reverse video on xterm/man
Nntp-Posting-Host: nova.bellcore.com

Lines: 22

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway.
I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently,
I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with "".I"" directives
that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.
The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at.
Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords
displayed with underlining....

So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under "".I"" directives 
for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. ("".B"" 
directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit
the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
and a bold font, but not an italic font??

Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thanks -- John

P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...

This is incorrect.  Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide, and as 
manager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that
work on Devguide is continuing apace.  We had quite a strong show of interest
from the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference.
Devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but
as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current
customers and facilitate their migration to the COSE Desktop Environment.

Look in xfig.  It has two types of spline algorithms and is relatively simple.

BTW, the X11 tools come as sources. The sillyness of most vendors lets you

Anyway, have a look onto xgrab/xgrabsc. It does the IMHO best job for

	    Compiled by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This ""FAQ"" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    ""System Performance Tuning"" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the
    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written
    comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any
    other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the ""Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup"" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document
  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If
  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by
  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the
  command ""send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups"" in the message body.

-----------------------------
What about the ""Other X FAQ""?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

------------
The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.

                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to ""xrdb"" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  ""I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.""
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

-------
Clients
-------

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  From the README file distributed with xterm:

  +-----
  |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
  |
  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   ""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! ""

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

2) mterm
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

   ""I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is
   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""


Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu ""mouse settings"" {
        ""Mouse Settings:""			f.title
	""  Very Fast""				! ""xset m 7 10 &""
	""  Normal (Fast)""			! ""xset m 3 10 &""
	""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)""	! ""xset m default &""
	""  Glacial""				! ""xset m 0 10 &""
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?
- - - - - - 
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

----------------------------
Other Sources of Information
----------------------------

  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System
  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):
    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper ""Improving X
    Application Performance"" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in
    Issue 3 of The X Resource.

    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992
    conference proceedings.

    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.

Hello,

   When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
""cannot load app-defaults file..."" check your XAPPLRESDIR
environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory 
( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory
specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable.

   If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable
then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the
BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv
command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will
have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the
app-defaults to load correctly.

   To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all
the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults
file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or 
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is
set up.

   Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory
resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX. 
For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system
directory resource should be set like this :

*systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory

Have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to 
something other than 0 and 1?  The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.

Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  You could
have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)
might all be the same value?

If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,
don't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill.  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles.


Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics
don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle?

IMHO this whole discussion named ""Motif looks like MS-Windogs"" is totally
stupid. The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window
Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.
But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work
without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,
he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit
is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.

You cannot say ""A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer"" ONLY because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete
different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as MS-W.

   ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based
   formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and
   action-based, and the other symbol-based.

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*
of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After
all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a ""symbol manipulator"".

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think
like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not
required to do what they do. 

To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;
no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

 I have just finished building X11R5 on a 386 running Interactive Unix (SysVR3)

characters that are types, the cursor seems to be ""too"" large, or splits into
a 1/2 reverse video, 1/2 outline block (which changes when the pointer is moved
into the window).  I am trying to use monospaced fonts (not -p- fonts).  Is
there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm?

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,
and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,
but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks
promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,
and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.

At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body
comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me
no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only
library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending
nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause
short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve.

it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under, you can use the X

		Display *display;

as in

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the
other members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on
virtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the
**VAST** majority of all hardware).

Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
$100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
pertaining to Motif has been high.

I can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the ""free"" UNIX
platforms, I can't see this causing major problems.


Side Note :
---------
All the X based code I am writing (and will distribute freely when
completed) is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also ""look
and feel"" point of view I like it the best (no flames on this one
please).

Hello Motif World,

a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got
several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people
who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am
not aware of who are also using Motif++.

My question is:

How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the
user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this
way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
changed.

If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say
about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will
post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

Subject: Creating 8 bit windows on 24 bit display.. How?

Lines: 75

Greetings,


I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals:
PseudoColor 8 bit, Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24).

In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the
section about XCteateWindow, something like:
""In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the
parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used 
in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs.""

This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the X11R5 guides.

However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch
when I create a window with a non-default visual.
The code looks like this:

------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----------------

Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height)
Display *dpy;
int width, height;
{
  Window win;
  XVisualInfo vinfo;
  XSetWindowAttributes attr;

  fprintf(stderr,""Opening 8 bit window...\n"");
  if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {
    fprintf(stderr,""Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n"");
    exit(1);
  }
  fprintf(stderr,""Using visual: %x\n"",vinfo.visual->visualid);
  cmap = XCreateColormap(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           vinfo.visual,
           AllocNone
         );
  XSync(dpy,False);
  XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */
  attr.colormap = cmap;
  win = XCreateWindow(
          dpy,
          DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
          10,10,
          width,height,
          CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
          8,                    /* depth */
          InputOutput,          /* class */
          vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
          CWColormap,
          &attr
        );
  return win;
}

--- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT -----

Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.

Well, more information is required...

1) What computer are you using?
2) What operating system are you using?
3) What kind of printer are you using?
	a) PostScript?
	b) HP-PCL?

Hi,

I wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of
its childs. If it is not, then how could it be possible to implement a

Organization: Zentrum fuer Graphische Datenverarbeitung, Darmstadt, FRG

Hello Everybody!

I have a little question:

Due to more features (PEX, Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for
example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver.
X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my
question:

Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free
memory available to the Xserver?

So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the
CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).

Please reply via e-mail, I'll summarize!

Sincerly,
        Matthias

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X
Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price
titled ""Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco"".

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort.
Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib.
Features they want in FRESCO include:

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample
implementation.

I am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above.

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may 
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows. 
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.

 curs_move = XCreateFontCursor (disp_data, XC_crosshair);

 geom_vals.foreground     = blck_pixl ^ grey_dark;
 geom_vals.plane_mask     = AllPlanes;
 geom_vals.line_width     = 0;
 geom_vals.function       = GXxor;
 geom_vals.subwindow_mode = IncludeInferiors;
 evnt_mask= GCForeground | GCPlaneMask | GCLineWidth | GCFunction
                                                     | GCSubwindowMode;
 geom_gcon= XCreateGC (disp_data, root_iden, evnt_mask, &geom_vals);



later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic

/**********************************************************************/
 void Tselect::move_bands (int delt_xloc, int delt_yloc)          /****/
stuff deleted ...
            XDrawRectangle (disp_data,   root_iden,  geom_gcon,

                            sele_pntr->xlnth, sele_pntr->ylnth); undraw old one
            sele_pntr->papax+= delt_xloc;
            sele_pntr->papay+= delt_yloc;
            sele_pntr->rootx+= delt_xloc;
            sele_pntr->rooty+= delt_yloc;

  I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are
  populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.
  Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.
  An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always
  available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not
  really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting
  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come
  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for
  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.
  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.
  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely
  adopted.

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was 
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create 
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until 
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
	PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | 
	EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
	PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.


If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win 
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear 
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some 
detail I'm overseeing.

 From the README file of version 4.99c:

 This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size
 and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
 x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
 bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different
 line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in
 the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device
 drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile
 format and renderer.

 The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.
 The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
 is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely
 available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed
 somewhere in the documentation for the package.

 We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
 user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any
 published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,
 which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that
 as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the
 kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done.

 PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
 routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any
 modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the
 header file ""plplot.h""; see the documentation for more details.

 The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of
 several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex
 plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  

 At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:

	 Unix:	SunOS
		 A/IX 
		 HP-UX
		 Unicos
		 DG/UX
		 Ultrix
		 SysV
		 Linux

	 Amiga/Exec
	 MS-DOS
	 OS/2
	 NeXT

 For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:
  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual
  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7.
When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows
are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server
to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen
for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some

Subject: need help with Athena Text Widget
Organization: National Institute of Standards & Technology, Gaithersburg, MD
Lines: 24

I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.

I want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
visible.

In trying to do this I have two problems:

 - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
   taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.

 - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
   in order to keep the insertion point visible.

Any help is appreciated.

Mike

Before I try to teach myself how to write a widget and (perhaps)
re-invent the wheel...

Is there a PD widget that displays (for example) an 8-bit grey-level
image in the same fashion that the Athena Plotter Widget can be used
to display a plot?

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle, thus they set this limit.

Didn't your operating system come with X?  SysV usually does as far

Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does
the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference
just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,
it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're
probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just 
that.

In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns.

I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0
(a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).  I'm 
running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have
the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others):
  wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin
  wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True
  wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True
  wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False
  wscrawl*background:		LightBlue
  wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow
  wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue
  wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer

Naturally, I exited the server and restarted it after adding
those lines to .Xdefaults .

If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):
  xrdb -m .Xdefaults
and then start up wscrawl, then all those defaults are used
properly.  Wonderful, yes?  Except that I can't get them to be
operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned
xrdb command.  If I try:
  xrdb .Xdefaults
the defaults ""won't take.""

So, I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:
  xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults
to:
  xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults

No go.  So I tried adding in:
  xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults
at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go.

Any notions what gives?  Thanks for the help.

""return_place"" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an
integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there,
and returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when
you're done.

The simple answer is for you to obtain use XView to do this.  XView is a

  Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for ""cheap"",
but I cannot get the source for ""cheap"", hence I am limited to using whatever X
libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not
seen it myself).

  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which
only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5
libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the
vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same
problem when X11R6 becomes available.

  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do
not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of ""free"", doesn't it?

The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid?
Just because something appears in an 8 bit deep pixmap doesn't
mean every bit plane contains data.  Did you try each plane?

I can think of two different methods that you could try. 1) use fork and

It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem, and have
given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what
keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun
from my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not
sufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work.
However, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work,
and I do some customised things with them.

Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem, and I am using exactly
the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

Begging everyone's pardon, I was not slamming Motif, nor was I necessarily 
plugging/flaming the two.  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:
 <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson)

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will
also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not,
by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience),
and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as
mentioned before, the ""socialistic masses"" that were bent on destroying 
_anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned
Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its
attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is
a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be
free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are 
no de facto standards.

It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.

Lines: 50



I am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system.  In keeping with more classic command and
control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  
I have a number of X level questions regarding this:

(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be 
predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,
and not multiple X displays.   Given this:

	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's
	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
	screens?

	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate
	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
	What are they; who sells them...

	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a
	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?

	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see
	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?

	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
	multiple screens instead)?  
	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely
	on providing config files which will specify for each
	configuration the screen placement of each window in the
	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
	are more than welcome.

G'Day

Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who
think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to 
be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for 
granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 
3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
a real issue. My ideal operating system:

	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize
	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have
	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...

	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac 
	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which 
	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 
	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.
	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.

	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton 
	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.
	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on 
 	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.

	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS
	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.

	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have
	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.

In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean
kernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ?

	adios

would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server.

One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if
it does it may be in no condition to be ""pop[ped] to the top"" (eg, it
may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want -
consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
desktop.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the
environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window
on a different server, for example.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed""
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

> Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only
recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.
The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been
implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of
the new window.

This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is
CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't
match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a
border-pixel, and the problem should go away.

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that
CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to
XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines
CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib
implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm
not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)

No.  Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you
get it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering
user actions).  You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc
error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available.

Yes, but it's not an attribute of the window; it's an attribute of the

I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design
System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*.
Normally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally
it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become
""washed out"" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something
brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT.

By slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.

I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even
on large monitors. 

This version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.Z.
The README file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.

In my case, I built the X Server first, Xview second, then olvwm. All of these
were installed into /usr/X5. Once I verified the server worked correctly,
I happily issued ""rm -rf /usr/openwin/*"".

Using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
is, for all intents and purposes, identical to OpenWindows 3.0 and that is     
incredibly faster. There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work _exactly_ like OpenWindows, but not much.

We've been using it for a year on Unix (Sun and HP) and Windows platforms.  In my
opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market.  It supports a rich API to a high

Or read fixes 9, 10, and 11 to the MIT distribution.  This is a known 
problem - just apply those fixes and set SunPost411FCSLd to YES and 
OSTeenyVersion in mit/config/sun.cf to 3.

In fix-09:
|If you are running SunOS 4.1.1 and you apply Sun's ld patch 100170-6,
|then you will need to edit your site.def and add this line to the
|AfterVendorCF section:
|
|#define SunPost411FCSLd   YES

In fix-10:
|If you are running SunOS 4.1.2, change OSTeenyVersion in mit/config/sun.cf to
|have a value of 2.

In fix-11:
|Brief notes on what this patch fixes:

Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. For your purpose put following into your
.login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.

if ( ""$term"" == ""xterm"" ) then
	echo ""^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G""
endif

Note, ^[ stands for <Esc>, in vi you can enter it by pressing
Ctrl-V and the <Esc>. Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi:
press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G.
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon.

BTW, you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd:

alias cd 'cd \!* ; echo ""^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G""'

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more.""

Subject: Creating application contexts multiple times???
Nntp-Posting-Host: bruno.cs.colorado.edu

Lines: 94

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read
on...

I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,
displays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The
problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems
including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):

- Core Dump
- BadPixmap X Error
- Widget not unmapped


Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem:

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>

void bla()
{
        XtAppContext app;
        Display *dis = XOpenDisplay("""");
        int junk = 0;

        Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app, ""test"", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""blaaa"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        top,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(top);
        //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents
        for (int i=0;i<=10;i++)
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }

// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???
        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);
        XtDestroyWidget(top);
        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);
        XCloseDisplay(dis);
// ???
}

main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
                bla();
}

Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,
after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.
With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)
the 5th call to bla():

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d
  Serial number of failed request:  71
  Current serial number in output stream:  86

If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the
seconds call.

Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I
get:

Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice
Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice.


So finally, my question is this:

What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.

Thanks very much.

I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The
X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I
supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,
but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can
be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but
I'm *really* confused.

Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install
the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,
and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old
server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,
and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs?

Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public?
It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budgets. :)

Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it).

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors)
The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field.

The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done.

When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.
This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the
default either.

Configuration is  : Motorola 88K X11R4

Please reply by email if poss.

Thank you

Hello world,

I want to write my Xt-application code like this:

{
    do_some_work();
    /* now I need some user input */
    XmCreateDialog();
    wait_for_user_input(input);
    if (input == ""OK"") {
       more_work();
    } else {
       other_work();
    }
}

So ""more_work() and other_work()"" are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question.

How can I code this in my Xt/Motif-application?

Thanks very much in advance.

Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?

If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.

Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.

Hi Folks.

As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple
icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can
just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately
you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with
icons which your application doesn't specifically own.

In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the
icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes
any difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.

Thanks -
Scott :)

Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5

	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation
	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version
	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).
	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error
	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the
	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 
	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 
	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).
	
	Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered
			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
			to do about?

	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
Window is mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to ""tickle"" a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?

Use a GC with the subwindow_mode attribute set to IncludeInferiors. The
default is ClipByChildren. However, beware if any of the children are of
a different depth to the parent; the semantics of this are undefined by the

It's probably easy, but I've only been programming in X for a little while.

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

Summary: Redesign required.

If you're willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you
want, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that
in our internal LYMB system.

We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then
drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and
changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.

Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You
can make things look circular enough.

You've got to set border_pixel in your window attributes. The default
is CopyFromParent which gives the BadMatch. Do this:

   ...
   unsigned long valuemask;
   ...
   /*
    * if border_width is non-zero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap
    * rather than use any old pixel value. Also, use valuemask, it makes

    */
   attr.colormap = cmap;
   attr.border_pixel = 0;
   valuemask = CWColormap | CWBorderPixel;
   win = XCreateWindow(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           10,10,
           width,height,
           0,		         /* border width. see comment below */
           8,                    /* depth */
           InputOutput,          /* class */
           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
           valuemask,
           &attr
         );

A note on border_width: your code looked like this:

>>   win = XCreateWindow(
>>           dpy,
>>           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
>>           10,10,
>>           width,height,
>>           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
>>           8,                    /* depth */
>>           InputOutput,          /* class */
>>           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
>>           CWColormap,
>>           &attr
>>         );

border_width set to CopyFromParent works but doesn't make sense.
border_width should be an unsigned int. You get away with it because
CopyFromParent is #define'ed to be zero in X.h. If it happened to be
defined as -1 you'd get a very interesting looking window!

1) This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm.
2) This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible, are they ?
   Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they
   are ? I would think they are DCS (device control sequence) introduced,
   but may be a CSI sequence exists, too ?
   This MUST work on a dxterm (VT and ANSI compatible), it may not work
   on xterms.

It seems like XTranslateCoord. doesn't work the way I expecting it.  Right
after performs a XMoveWindow, I want to know the absolute window position
with respect to the root window.  To get this info. I do a XTranslateCoordinates
but the abs_x, and abs_y aren't right?  Does anybody know of a way to find 
out this information?

Thanks, please e-mail to hsteve@carina.unm.edu if it's possible

Many X servers supporting graphics accelerators do not allow the creation
of pixmaps exeeding the size of the screen.  One workaround is to create
several smaller pixmaps and add the results.

How much support do you need?  I don't think there's anything
that prohibits you from implementing such a widget, though you
will have to write your own versions of the functions that draw
the 3D shadow and traversal highlighting.

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network
itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell
file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our
Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each
segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have
10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.

Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going
to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)

Hi netters,

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem?

Any help is very much appreciated.

(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
""regular"" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a ""proper"" way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow ""tickle"" the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.

What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

Subject: Drawing Lines (inverse/xor)
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 40

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed.

Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:

   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);

Then to draw I do:

   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an
Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item.

This is still not great, since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item ""on top"" of the
existing scene.

I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program?
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow?

I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this
true?

Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?


Environment:
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 1.1
     GL is available

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all
forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any
internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
updating the datastructures though...

So what is my problem? How to modify the contents of the colormap?

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.
It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look
ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications
are having to make do with it's colormap.

This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have
seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.
My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color (if this is an option for the application).

From the XmTextField man page (during discussion of resources):

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping
as it should.  To turn off this behavior, set this boolean resource to false.

If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send
exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib
graphics on the window.

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to
send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects,
you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the
new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region
to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your
other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order
of overlapping objects affects how they look.

Hope it helps

What does this have to do with my original question???  I previously
stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.  This is NOT
a problem with expose events, it has to do with XCopyPlane not
working!!!

Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
XCopyPlane works???  This would be very helpful!

Thanks!

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple ""open-draw-quit"" client.  

As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the ""window_redraw()"" (or whatever) directly?  Although, depending
on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

   Environment:
      mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (IPX)
      OS	: SunOS 4.1.3
      X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)
      Motif	: 1.2.2

I bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence
of actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion 
to X server lost):

   1. xinit -- Xsun
   2. start mwm
   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
   4. move the window by dragging the title bar.

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:

  ""Connection to X server lost""

or
  
  ""Connection broken (errno=32)""

(I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).

Next, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:

  select returns -1
  Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560


Note:
 * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). 
 * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
 * I am not running font server. 
 * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.
 * My font path:
     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi

   (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,
   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
   and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).

 * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines. I do not see this 
   problem on IPC workstations.

Questions:
 * What the hell is goin on ? :-)
 * What does ""status 2560"" mean (of the server).

I'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the GC to be (foreground^background).

Summary: how can I force a strip chart to update

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's
get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am
not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).

Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will
call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  

In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.

Any ideas anyone?

I need to write an application which does annotation notes

several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen
something like this being done by the oclock client.
Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt?

This is probably cheating, and some window managers might STILL refuse to

Any ideas? Is it a Motif problem...are the DEC and Apollo versions of Motif

uses dxterm by default, and we have a lab of Apollo workstations we would like
to run Oracle from.

Subject: XAllocColor fails to return nearest match

[posted for a friend]

Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its
come up before...

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:
    Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)
    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.
	and when all else fails, 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors 
    already allocated in the colormap.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way
though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and 
no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens 
of read-only cells already in the colormap.

Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?

Any help appreciated,

This design will work but I don't think it can take easily take advantage
of expose event redraw optimization; that is, the whole window will be

The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its

it thinks the window is already in the right place.

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP

running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making
TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can
not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated.

Well, the first 2 are easy.  You need the math library.  Try adding -lm after

Subject: GCC and Building the HP Widget Set on Linux
Reply-To: wpwood@austin.ibm.com (Bill Woodward)
Organization: The Institute of Knowledge on Jinx
Lines: 30


I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.
	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite
widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :

	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)

but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the
insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:

	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)

Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.
	Many thanks in advance for any help.

I recently compiled the X11R5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on
a Sun3/80. Everything seems to work fine. Usually. But at
seemingly random times the server will just hang. I will
click the mouse somewhere (never happens while my back is turned),
and without warning, it will freeze there, requiring the server
to be killed. Sometimes it will run fine for weeks, sometimes
only for minutes.

(Os: 4.1.1; frame buffer: bw2).

Has anyone seen this before, any ideas? (anything at all?)

I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box
running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working, but
I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from
my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file
using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:

  ""xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner""

Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line,
it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm),
and a clock, from my .xsession also works.

Anyone encountered this?  Suggestions?

I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that
comes with the IPX.  What fixed the problem for me was to apply the ""sunGX.uu""
that was part of Patch #7.  Patch #1 also used this file so perhaps you
didn't apply the one that came with Patch #7.

Unless you run `xlock -mode blank`, xlock consumes CPU time generating

xlock for the CPU. If you run top (via a remote login), you can really

Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences
as that for VT340 (or colour decterm/dxterm)? I thought that was called
colxterm (and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or
might be my program going wrong).

Summary: Clipping of character's high order bit

Lines: 38

I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being 
clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed
the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the
following line in .Xdefaults:

~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\

I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm
which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the 
application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e>
sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each
character being filtered or ignored.

When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing 
up in the following two key events:

  KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  """"

  KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  """"

Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe.
But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to 
spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.

Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to
the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Please *email* any responses.

  Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in

though, so I can't find the exact location :)

  WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling
noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it
anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying
to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's
turning into a Hard Job.

  Check out your ""info"" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on
whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about
doing so.

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension.
You can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets
support SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that
functionality.

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:

	1. Set the window background to None,
	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),
	3. Restore the window background to its correct value.

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client
messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

What it has to do with your original question is this: many times 
beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test
programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to
eliminate all the ""easy"" explanations  for why you're not seeing your
graphics. 

That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
to see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

I think you are running Xapollo , it's a X11R3 server ...

If you want a X11R4 server you should install PSKQ3 (10.3.5) or 10.4
  so you can run Xdomain .

Reply-To: D.Haywood@sheffield-hallam.ac.uk
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: ""probably incorrect"")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.
(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.

Make sure you're using ""ssetroot"", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an ""ssetroot"" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a ""(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&"")
You can also use ""VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename"" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?

Keywords: GLX mixed-model,colormap
Organization: DSG, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA
Lines: 71


Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts,
I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments
(entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX;
also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common
problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level
windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.

I would dearly appreciate
  1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window
  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;

  2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
  desired colormaps.

By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable.

Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING*
to do this.  Please, please, please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing
wrong/how to do it right!!!

Hello Netlanders:

       I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.

       My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows:

       486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4 
       Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.
       I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and
       inet utilities (tcp/ip).
       I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.
 
 I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.
 However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the
 machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the
 tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to
 startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background
 pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login
 from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.

 I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4
 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also 
 claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't
 need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get
 XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
 packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.

 I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same
 system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.
 
 One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true,
 what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give
the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So
a ""hourglass"" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a
""caution"" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in
another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.
So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain
subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined
for some windows, e.g. a ""crosswire"" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even
more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this
so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me
know. The topics on ""busy cursors"" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since
they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window
attribute set to 'None'.

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to
run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office.

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended
PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on
my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. 
The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. 
On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows
installation.


The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory
had the line
DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY

s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console.
By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned
and the clients connected to the server at

`hostname`:1.0

Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru
a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line.
My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB

Bitmap Stuff Sucked.
Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.
Xmail was very usable.

At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was
a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged ""WINDOWS
should not be called a SCHEDULER"", besides that this will become
my remote work environment for a while.

Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales
person said they performed about the same, given the over head of
WINDOWS I question this?

The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be ""Tek-term"") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon.


The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one.

    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm.

What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.
These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.

Thanks for your time.  If you've got any words of wisdom (other than 
""give up"" ;-), please send email to

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure.

I can vouch for that. The GL Widget works pretty well. I have been using it
for sometime now. I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget. I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely. Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
Better still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the ""mixed-model programming""
paradigm(Mixing X and GL).

: |> Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?
:

Well, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but 
then, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.

  If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.
  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server.
  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which
  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc
  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations.

Subject: XQueryBestCursor semi-broken?
Organization: National Center for Atmospheric Research
Lines: 18

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see
if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the
server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X
servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while
others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing
to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -
a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a
Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on
NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. 
Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root
winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this
behavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!

XDM is not just an X Window client.  XDM has its own protocol (XDMCP) that
operates of UCP on port 177.  It does provide a Login window which is an
X Window Client.  As to using DECnet protocol.  Looking through the source
for XDM from X11R5 that I have here, it seems that the bare bones code is
there but not completely there.

#
#My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making

From my look at the source, it seems you cannot run it over DECnet as shipped
with X11R5.

Subject: XmScale & XtAddEventHandler
Organization: The Internet

Dear Xperts,

I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select
an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the
name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale
button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays
the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding
image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do
the mapping between the scale value and the file name:

XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);


and in the eventhandler do a:

  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))
   ;
  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);
  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/


However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co
   urse
a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin
   g wrong?
Or is the a wrong approach to this problem?
Any hints are highly appreciated.

This isn't of much help! Especially when doing Phigs (PEX) via the libphigs as

have enough memory!

   xswa.backing_store      = NotUseful;
   xswa.event_mask         = ExposureMask | StructureNotifyMask;
   xswa.background_pixel   = bg_pix;

   graphic_window =

                       CWEventMask | CWBackingStore | CWBackPixel,
                       &xswa );
   XMapWindow( graphic_display, graphic_window );
   
   /** sync and wait for exposure event **/
   XSync( graphic_display, False );
   XWindowEvent( graphic_display, graphic_window, ExposureMask, &exposureEvent );

   conn.display     = graphic_display;
   conn.drawable_id = graphic_window;

   xinfo.display = graphic_display;
   xinfo.flags.no_monitor = 0;      /* False -> Monitor is running! */
   xinfo.flags.force_client_SS = 0; /* False! */

   popen_xphigs( NULL, 0, PXPHIGS_INFO_FLAGS_NO_MON |
                          PXPHIGS_INFO_FLAGS_CLIENT_SS |
                          PXPHIGS_INFO_DISPLAY, &xinfo );

   popen_ws( 1, (Pconnid)(&conn), phigs_ws_type_x_drawable );

I get core dumps in the popen_ws call! (No BadAlloc, etc.! Simply a core
dump!) So I need some way of getting info about the maximal available memory
to the Xserver!

But thanks!

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
                /**/#This is a makefile
        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
        preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
        start of a directive. 

        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
        that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
        fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to
'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

I have a question regarding the processing of program arguments

I'm wondering wether I have to parse it manually or whether there
is some predefined function that will do this for me?

The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico
State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The
archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical
Research.

The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address
is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
possible).

Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research.

The Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Korean,
Tibetan, and Vietnamese archives will all be moved.

We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved.

Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move
everything.

If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been
slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different
languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multi-lingual tools.

If you have an item to contribute, please put it in:

clr.nmsu.edu:incoming/

and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your
contribution.

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to:
lexical@nmsu.edu

These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these

manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.
I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if
you specify the position and size like above.

It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original
question:

I usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop
menu. Here is a sample command:

	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i &

The -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. As I use the
tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), I can do the following:

I have an

	alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\;${HOST}:$cwd^G'

in my ~/.tcshrc. This is a special alias for tvtwm. It is executed each time
before printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current
directory path in the title bar of my xterms.

Have you gotten an answer yet?  Using your variables, this is what I would do:

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage.  Once this is done, the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable.

Subject: Calling a library which creates widgets (multiple times)
Nntp-Posting-Host: bruno.cs.colorado.edu
Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder
Lines: 91

A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should
never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having
some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable
from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is
called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the
old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,
main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents
the interface to the library function.

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)
{
        Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars
        XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class
        int junk = 0;
        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,
                                        NULL);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""blaaa"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        topone,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(topone);
        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when ""Exit"" button clicked
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(box);
        XtCloseDisplay(dis);
}

// SetItUp - should be called once only
void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)
{
        int junk = 0;
        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, ""test"", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);
}

// doit - some library function callable from the outside
void doit()
{
        static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called
        static Widget top;

        static int setup = 0;

        if (!setup)
        {
                SetItUp(&app, &top);
                setup = 1;
        }
        bla(app, top);
}

// main - program which links to my library
main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
                doit();
                printf(""sleeping...\n"");//widget still on screen at this point
                sleep(5);
        }
}


The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.
(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the ""sleep"" in the main prog,
despite the XtDestroyWidget call).

Anyone see something I'm missing?

Thanks very much.

I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we
have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out?

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one
menu entry.

In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says ""For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4..."", this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to
Vol. 4 it says, ""Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For
example, the translation:

	Shift<Key>q:	quit()

will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key (and the q key).

This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do
what I want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the
control key, the shift key, and the o key.

Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in

I'm an new to this.  Having found some files (public) to look into, I
ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC
file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress
and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid.
What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed,
binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy
to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  Any help is appreciated.

Try this:

char *name=NULL;
unsigned long value;

if(XGetFontProperty(font, XA_FONT, value)) 
    name=XGetAtomName(dpy, value);

where dpy is your Display connection and font your XFontStruct pointer.

In SGI's distribution with their Indigo line (others as well, possibly),

one that's Xt based as well.  You may wish to ask IBM whether they

Subject: Expose/Configure event handling (R4 vs R5)
Organization: UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
Lines: 29

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to
find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as
CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my
window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in
another window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely
NOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell
me that information.

My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock and/or NumLock is?

An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user
presses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.

Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will
repost a summary of my findings.

2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?
   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).
   Where can we catch all events coming from a given

   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

      Try change the GXxor to GXequiv.  I have to do this for programs that
      are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it
      back to GXxor)...

There is a small section in the O'Reilly Xlib books that describes
the right thing to do.  The key is to set the plane_mask in the
GC to the OR of the foreground and background pixel values.

If you are using the Intrinsics, it is parsed for you.  If you are working
at the Xlib level, you can parse it yourself or you can use the following
bit of code.

static XrmOptionDescRec options[] = {
	{""-geometry"",	"".geometry"",	XrmoptionSepArg, (XPointer)NULL}
};

#define Number(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0]))
XrmParseCommand(db, options, Number(options), ""MyApplication"", &argc, argv);

Then use XrmGetResource() to retrieve the value and parse it using
XParseGeometry().

It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv, however, I much prefer
using the X resource management routines to do this.

Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever client-server communications
mechanism you are using.

Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps?
These are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is
much cheaper.

Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running
in XSynchonize mode.

#Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain?
#I need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program.
#
#Appreciate the help.
#

I don't know if this might help, but I've just started playing with a program
called POVRay (Persistance of Vision Raytracer) that also displays its output
via X Windows.  It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
Psuedo-Color 8-plane display.  I got the source from from a site in Canda.
The person I retrieved them from was David Buck (dbuck@ccs.carleton.ca).

What ""it may think is right"" may be exactly what the user wants.
Assuming that your application ""has reason to know better"" is, IMHO,
anti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are
you going to ignore that as well?

There's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything
if it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's
no guarantee that you're going to get what you want.

You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt.
USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the
position and size.

You say: ""Tom, don't blow a gasket, what's the harm?""

Some window managers do very different things (besides positioning the window)
when they see USPosition rather than PPosition.

Hi there netters,

I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my
screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to
go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with
the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner
so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller,
which expects the window at the same spot every time.

Thanks in advance.

sincerely,

I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just

way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or

Just an idea, if you like it, use it.

Subject: Detecting read-only colorcells?
Reply-To: ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov
Organization: Colorado School of Mines
Lines: 27

[again, poseted for a friend]

Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), 
lets try again:

How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only?

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap
once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color.

Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request
an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will 
then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another
application.

So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my
colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable.
But life would be much easier if I could just detect the
read-only/shareable stuff directly...

Any ideas?

If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm ""InstallWindowColormaps()"" crash bug

""twm"" or ""tvtwm"", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to

Hello...

I wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question:
I am a total X novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have.

I am trying to create a simple drawing tool....

       __________
       |        |
       |     ___|___
       |_____|__|  |
             |	   |
	     |_____|

Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) 
one intersecting the other...
Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles.
The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the
GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel 
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is 
something that should be avoided.

Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
rectangle too?
I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
as this degrades performance very badly...


Thank you...

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms:

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).
  DEC Ultrix.
  DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1).

Documentation is available online.

Changes since 0.13 include:

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
 o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's.

	There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we
are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!

} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the
} latest version of Xkernel)

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8).  I may be able to answer questions; feel free
to email me.

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display
rates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on IPX) that I get with Sunview, though
it's a bit ""choppy"" at times. Also, loading the data, making an XImage,
then XPut'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is
slower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the
data?

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some
documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-
resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code
mentioned above...

Thanks for the help so far. If I get something decent put together, I'll
definitely post it to the Net.

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory, this is the hog. The conversions in the XPutImage() are
fast.

Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.

No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()
BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !

Subject: Vanishing font problem....
Organization: Department of Mathematics, Queen's University at Kingston
Lines: 25

   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.
When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a
second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier
colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different
font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
directories/hash-tables.

   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?

More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),
       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.
       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

Hello,

I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture
machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple
terminal emulator program).

The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
server for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely
spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the 
rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the 
rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual
characters.

If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to
find it, it would be much appreciated.

Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,
the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:
""Ctrl Any<Key>q"".

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If
you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
translations.

>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?

If you mean ""menu accelerator"", no it's not possible.  That's according to
the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.

>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you

I can't think of a reason why not.

>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of

There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators
resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).

For example,

  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade
					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton
							  - exitPushbutton

  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O
  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O
  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q
  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q

  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\
    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\
    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)

You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you
can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then
XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.

I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I
used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I
described above should work.

  The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared
  Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms
  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an
  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
  transparent.
  As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.
  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this
  code can Email me.

Thanks for docs info. It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And
VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

  There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
X11R5 distribution.

  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...
(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using
on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they
were just about equal.

  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous
sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your
application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps).

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be
attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes
XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24
bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to
use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).

  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a
Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest.

  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)

Subject: dynamic SqueezeTitle configuration in *twm
Keywords: TWM, twm, vtwm, tvtwm, ctwm
Organization: Systems Strategies, Inc., NY, NY
Lines: 123

I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window
manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have
other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.

In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude
picture:

 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================
 |
 |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+
 |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +
 |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +
 |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |
 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================

Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,
with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really
need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.

The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it
is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and
time-consuming.

Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }
functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click
of a button, you can change this:

    +---------+
    + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

to this:

                   +---------+
                   + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

 ===============

Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this
into the next ""official"" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,
and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this
enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a
Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)

In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing,
look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of
windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title;
but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:

        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+
        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +
        +-------------------------------------+
        +   this is the body of the window,   +
        +   window A, which is on top.        +
        +-------------------------------------+

 ===================

The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my
X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long.

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:

#ifdef SHAPE
	case F_SQUEEZELEFT:
	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };
		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))
		  return TRUE;

		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;
		SetFrameShape( tmp_win );
		break;
	}
	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and
	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...
#endif

( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h
  and add
    { ""f.squeezeleft"", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },
     ... and so forth ...
to parse.c

In order to use these functions, add something like the
following to your .twmrc file:

Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter

 =================

About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I
*think* it didn't get out.

Since then, ""blast"" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,
Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by
chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a
twm-style window manager, I think.

There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display
device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently
the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen
memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).  

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to 
main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy
rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than
off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather
than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)

If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into
pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are
likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation
of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then
just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.

One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them.

One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation,
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., ""kill"").  You have to 
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

 Hi Xperts!
   I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.
   previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then 
   i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative
was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in
not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.

   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files 
required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw.
In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from
the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows
 
 BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi
 and misc. 

when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the
default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no
disk space. 
Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to
just have my x-windows running. 

Thanks

I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX

""Motif"" includes Xt in this context.

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have

a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they

Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested

This code will almost certainly break.  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager.  Even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window, so you don't know how far to move it.  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window?

	Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server.  xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and
everything else, you have a workstation.  There are workarounds, I've
heard, one involving a perl script.  What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that
don't (like ghostview).
	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I
have no personal experience with it.

I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one
resource called ""accelerators"" that took a translation table, period.
I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified
one, it would be active and automatically installed.

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:

	*menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\
		Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\
		Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n

The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a ""Ctrl M"" show up in your menuItem object.

Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There
has to be some reason.

Sorry for the political tone of this message...

  Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return
  memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does
  not shrink).

  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,
  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone.
  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)
  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,
  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more
  shared memory segment.
  Terrible, but it works.

I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics

when creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode.

I have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button
presses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL 
mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child
of a manager.  Put another way, the translations do not work 
when the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a 
shell.  Does anyone know why this is happening?

I know for a fact that the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS
works.  However, an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money.

When XFree86 2.0 comes out, with support for accelerated chipsets, ISA,
EISA, and VLB will all be supported.

The more important question is ""what chipsets are supported?"".  The bus
is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue.

You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the
bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one
that is to stay with GXclear.  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with
the screen.  

Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever
need to do that (replace the GXclear with a GXxor).

They come with every Iris now.  Nth also ships it with their latest

ago.  I would assume that Silicon Graphics would license the source

Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something
which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this
as an alternative.

   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
   yet have the spec)?

Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you
looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD 
widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.

Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and
found what I was looking for.

ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one
for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies
from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and
which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).
eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris
1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an
unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any
given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.

In using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , I notice that it

sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally.
Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?

xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.

I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc
and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a 
simple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing
something simple here.

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about
the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is
down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most
work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than
using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it
before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at
the moment.)
	I don't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in
less time IF you are experienced.
	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than
DOS).

I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and

in Internet land might be able to help.

I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would
like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my
/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with
gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,
so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message
along the lines of:

Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket

Fatal server error : no screens found 


Any ideas on how I can fix it?  Please respond by e-mail at the below

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
		/**/#This is a makefile
	at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
	preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
	start of a directive. 

	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
	as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
	that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
	fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for

have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the ""user"" window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each
modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier
you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier).

I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.

X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. 

Hope that helps,

It might be that the X terminal doesn't support the ""Postscript
Extensions to X"" product.  I use the 'dxpsview' program on a 
DECstation 5000 to view postscript files but when I moved to an
NCD X terminal, I couldn't use it any more.  So I ftp'd and
compiled GhostScript (GNU software).  Now we can view postscript
files on our X terminals.

Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence ""ESC [ 1 B 7"" 
would indicate that the ""HOME"" key was pressed, with the shift key
down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such
as ""shift-Return"".

If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file ""x11term.c"".  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got
bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods 
somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.

Notes: 

 * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which 
   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.

 * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2
   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else.

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ.
Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't
seen the FAQ lately to check.]


Two ways:
 
 1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:
         -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label
         -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title
         -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE

 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:

    The basic escape sequence is:
	ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL

    where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,
    <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending
    on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,
    or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.

    Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:
         echo ""\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    To set just the icon title:
         echo ""\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    To set just the window title:
         echo ""\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,
    depending on how the echo command works on your system
    and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics
    under Bourne or Korn shells).

    [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of
    /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have
    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string
    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]

    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show
    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll
    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.
    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...

I have had the exact same problem, but have not figured out a solution.
I run a PC with Linux (free-unix) with X11r5 and OpenWindows 3.0, I

Hi,

I just got XFree86 running on my pc with Consensys and encountered a few
minor (I hope) probems.

The pc is hooked up to a LAN where I want remote X applications to 
connect to my X-server.  I believe the command to permit this is
xhost.  When I'm logged on my pc and type 'xhost + '  ,  I get the error message saying
""You must be on local machine to enable access"". 
what does this mean ?  ain't I already on the local machine?

Another problem I have is with the mouse movement.  I find that the 
mouse cursor moves extremely slow and choppy.
How can I make the mouse cursor move more accurately?


thank in advance.
Any help is much appreciated.

In my .Xresources I had a space after XTerm*font:   10x20.
Removing this and xrdb fixed my problem.

Also, same symptom, was that some of my users did not have the

I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain
X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie
where to get the latest version).
For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable
'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),
what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
or such stuff.

To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and
ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on

141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/

The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from
POVRay 1.0

Thanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the
same direction.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue
its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue
first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.
The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the
location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem.)

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:

1) Use ""twm"" or ""mwm"" rather than ""olwm""
2) Use ""olwm"", with resource ""*wmTimeout: 10""
3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

This is obviously working around some bug somewhere.

Subject: Overriding window manager focus processing
Organization: GE Information Services, Rockville, MD
Lines: 44
NNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu
Keywords: Window Manager Focus Motif

     I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to 
override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am 
using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be 
working with Open Look in the future.

     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one window of the application to 
another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top 
of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks 
the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the 
window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain 
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to 
beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window 
A.

      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that 
this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this 
case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default 
processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the 
switch.

      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very 
kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force 
the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call 
and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary 
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
twice.

      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* 
window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to 
actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this 
newsgroup.

Cheers....     Randall

I ran in to this problem I while ago, and from what I remember you should use
XtTranslateCoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate
the location of the popup, then use something like XtVaSetValues on the
popup widgets before ever using them.  Calling SetValues repeatedly (e.g.
every time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down.  I never
delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...

Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at
UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design
currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget.  

Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of
frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and
things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?

Any and all help would be very appreciated.

Many thanks,

I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
MB1).

I am considering making a reasonably large application for free

I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools

In my humble opinion, they look like crap.  I don't know, however, if
this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste
in the programmers.

I would like my app to look a little more ""sculptured"" like mwm.  I

I am getting Linux, so I will have InterViews, but I don't know how it
will look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't

If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much

Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?

Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5
Server Hardware:	Sun IPC
Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)

A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will
unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers
(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no
problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.

I have tried the following things:

    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       (100444-37).

    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).
       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of
       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I
       was still able to get the application to hang.

Repeat By:

This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs


Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

If you're on the internet and your site isn't sheltered from external
tcp/ip traffic, you can use the Remote Andrew Demo to see what the
Andrew Toolkit looks like:

Remote Andrew Demo Service

This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit applications
without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the Andrew software.  You
need a host machine on the Internet, and you need to be running the X11
window system.  A simple ""finger"" command will allow you to experience
ATK applications firsthand.  You'll be able to compose multimedia
documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the
Andrew Message System to browse through CMU's three thousand bulletin
boards and newsgroups.

To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command
on your machine:

    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.

Organization: CenterLine Software, Inc.
Lines: 33
NNTP-Posting-Host: 140.239.3.202

Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is
driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.

I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an
additional resource name level.

To illustrate I have an application with the following widget
heirarchy:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Application Widghet

I want the following:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Intermediate Widget
	         |
	 Application Widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.

I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example
and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets.

Please respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated.

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.

If you can use 386bsd:
	there is xview3 (OpenLook)

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C++ toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via e-mail
		 It has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used
		 to create graphical front-end to programs.
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs. I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.
		 Last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module. They have an MS-Windows driver module for instance.

	Also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful
	applications. For instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.
	With ease, I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,
	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database 
	operations,etc.. The author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router. I wrote  a simple
	strip chart script for displaying Real-Time ip received
	packets/seconds.


	Hope this helps,
	Amancio Hasty

I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system
that has a color hardcopy unit:

	xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0

I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager,
and it worked fine, but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image,
the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe,
by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud
and got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess, it seems like it's
running out of memory, but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg
swap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB.

This verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows 3.0 distribution
which I believe corresponds to X11 R4.

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Announcing tcpview: A Motif-based TCP/IP protocol analyzer
Organization: UW Networks and Distributed Computing
Lines: 89
Keywords: protocol analyzer TCP/IP
To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu


Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several
Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 
2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,
4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely
operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual 
manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found 
it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for
many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle
TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily
modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.

Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and
SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.
It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will
need Motif 1.1 or better.

The following files are available for anonymous ftp from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking

tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries
tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries

What tcpview adds to tcpdump:
- easier interface
- enhanced protocol decoding
- hex display of frame
- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt
- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name
- ethernet address host table
- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames
- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional
	processing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1

New features:

Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the 
file type will be automatically detected.

Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.

The hex format has been changed.

New time options have been added.

Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.

Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)

New flags:
-R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin
-ttt	prints delta times
-tttt	prints times relative to the first frame
-W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w)
-x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  
	Sample output:

Subject: How to see characterset from wchar_t
Nntp-Posting-Host: emu
Distribution: comp
Organization: Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan
Lines: 137


We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.
The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n
facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's 
X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit
uses Xsi.

Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.
In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed
to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with 
ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t
array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout
and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',
each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.

We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.

We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used
Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the
source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.


//I18N.h
// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-

					 char*, int*, int*, int*);
    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);
    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);
};

int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */
			  int wc_len,		/* IN */
			  char *buf,		/* OUT */
			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */
			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
			  char **charset)	/* OUT */
{
    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();
    int ctid;
    int status;
    Charset *xcharset;
    
    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,
				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);
    if (status == Success) {
	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));
	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;
    }
    else
	*charset = NULL;
    return status;
}
----------------

An included file above, ""Xlocaleint.h"", is also Xsi internal and we copied
the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.

A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on
our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.

When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:
    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)
    _Xmbfscs (code)
    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)
    _XFallBackConvert (code)

We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until
HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that
because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to 
know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used 
its internal functions. 

The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.
We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are
not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and
therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not
seem to lead us a solution.

My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check
character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?
If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we
want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.

In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery
to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for
the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source 
files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. 
Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.

I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area
even if it is not HP's implementation.

Thank you.

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

No, it isn't.  It is the ""X Window System"", or ""X11"", or ""X"" or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact,
doing ""man X"" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:

     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used
     when referring to this software:

                                  X
                           X Window System
                             X Version 11
                     X Window System, Version 11
                                 X11

There is no such thing as ""X Windows"" or ""X Window"", despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something
about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME
of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have 
to say?

With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can
buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both 
GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11
over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is
NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such 
software packages available.

X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and 
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. 

It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various 
sorts of hardware.

I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have

1024x768.

fix the table in .../X11R5/mit/server/ddx/sun/ or
use xmodmap(1).

put
  stty pass8; setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1; setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
in your .login. the first prevents the stripping of bit 7.
the second sets the locale. the third makes less(1) show the character

Hi !

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
I tried using the following Xlib code :

XVisualInfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
Colormap colormap;
XSetWindowAttributes attribs;
unsigned long valuemask = 0;
Window *win;
Xv_opaque frame;

win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);
XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);

/* So far so good */

colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);

/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */

attribs.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= CWColormap;
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);


Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Thanks again,

There are several products you might investigate.  If you've got
$20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good
choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar
architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact
information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't
be too hard to find.

If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook
(hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,
but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.

You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing
direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release
available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in
functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs
$495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells
allocated in the default colormap?

e.g.   colormap = DefaultColormap(mydisplay, myscreen);

The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells(mydisplay,
myscreen), but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be
much less than this, depending on the color requirements of the windows
currently in place. I'd like a way to determine this number. Thanks in

You can also set the Foreground to the XOR of the foreground and background

What I was talking about was using an Tek terminal as your X display.  I
should be possible to write an X server that does this as far as I can
tell, but what I'm asking is if there is already one.

I have an event handler working for a ButtonPressMask like:

  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, ButtonPressMask, FALSE,

but I would like to be able to have two types of actions: one to occur
with the left mouse, the other the right, and perhaps one with the
middle.  So my event handler would look more like:


  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, left-ButtonPressMask, FALSE,
                    show_left_mouse_position, plot_data);

  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, right-ButtonPressMask, FALSE,

However I don't know how to make my left-ButtonPressMask.  There didn't seem
to be one in the event mask lists I had on hand (although Button1MotionMask
looked promising).  My references also mentioned using ""|"" to or two
mask events.  Can you  use ""&"" to and two masks?  Would I want to in this

Hello folks,

I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map:

mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x

I've added a line in the start up file before the line
that starts mwm. It looks like the following:

xmodmap keymapfile
mwm

I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned
functions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc).

The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run

xmodmap keymapfile

from an xterm.

Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically
F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.

I realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to
implement, not time to learn how to implement.

To: xpert <xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu>

Hi Xperts,

this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.

Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem? 

Any help is very much appreciated.

Subject: 24-bit Static color: will clients like it?
Reply-To: roeber@cern.ch
Organization: CERN -- European Organization for Nuclear Research
Lines: 24

I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The
hardware is ""truecolor"" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit
static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just
present this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be 
acceptable to ""most"" X clients.  The three problems I see are:

  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.
  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the
     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.

Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these
limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff
floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, 
but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary.

I know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people's
opinions and suggestions.  Thanks!

I am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited
abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must
run on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The
sort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects
such as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are
sufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the
creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.
text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.

Does anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details
including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be
included in a product). Alternatively, send glossies to me at Logica,

x3 = 300;

@ = art tan (( 800 - 100)/(500 - 270)) = 71.81 degrees;

y3 = 100 + x3/tan(@) = 100 + 300/tan(71.81) = 198.58 ~= (integer) 199.

How do I prove XDrawLine() give me the right x3, y3 or not?
Please don't ask me why I don't created a 900x900 pixmap. No, I don't
wan to.

We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over

I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib

event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to 
receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server 
round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.

Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available
from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I 
just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is ""acceptable"" interactive 
response time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ?

Thanks.

The Andrew User Interface System is supported, maintained, enhanced, and
distributed by the Andrew Consortium, Carnegie Mellon.  The distribution
terms are those of the X consortium, not the GNU Public License.  Thus
anyone can commercially exploit the Andrew code without restriction. 
(To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the
latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to
explore the new capabilities.)

To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an X
server (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give the
command 

	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu 

for instructions.

NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar,
but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an option
in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor.

The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build
applications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is its
architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in
figure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not
usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and
printing.

Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: 
word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter
two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape
in December.)

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child
without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor.
The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got
picked up by the child.  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if
the timing was 'right'.

Keywords: sun sun3 X11R5 console
Organization: INMOS Limited, Bristol, UK
Lines: 23

We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully
started we run an xterm as the ""console"" - the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  ""Refresh window"" fails
to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them.

At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.
We're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.

My question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid
of these messages?

Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated

Depends on the nature of the ""rounding.""  X allows the user to do bit
arithmetic on pixel values, (i.e.,  XOR foreground and backgroun pixel
values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a
function of GXxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa).
If your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then 
clients that use them will break.

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit
TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were:

	1) Clients written with logic like the following:

	    if (DefaultDepth() != 1)
		/* Assume default depth is 8bit */

	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window
	   to run correctly.

	2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just
	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a
	   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps
	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but
	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start
	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.

Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many
clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a
default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client
writers to change their clients to do the right thing.

My OpenLook application has a few buttons. The first button turns
red(gets highlighted?) as soon as the sprite(mouse) is moved into the
application window. How do I suppress this?

I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect
English constructs such as ""its raining"" or ""it's window id"" annoy me.
However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way
things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS
was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically
superior as well!).

On a related topic, who is to say that ""color"" is more or less correct
than ""colour"" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed
to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API
terms such as ""XAllocColor"" and ""colormap"".

In a world that uses the term ""Windows"" to refer to Microsoft Windows,
perhaps the time has come to accept ""X Windows"" as a valid term for X.
I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,
""the X Window System"" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.
Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate
people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,
snappy, descriptive title (""X"" is positively obscure) will help
when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a
software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become
popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should
be called ""Microsoft Windows"" or ""the Microsoft Window System"" or
how about just plain ""Microsoft""!

To summarise (or should that be ""summarize"") the point of this message:
I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than
worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system
(or should that be ""windowing system""). Whatever gets recognised is
fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what
trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this
conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.

Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that ""popular
usage"" is not always sufficient excuse.  

In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or 
mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably
not.  

The same is true of X.  ""The X Window System"", ""X"", ""X11"", and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like ""X Window"" or
""X.windows"" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, 
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
*journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Popular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

*Tutorial topic*  
	_Converting Andrew source code to C++_

This tutorial will discuss the steps necessary to convert a site from C
(extended with classC) to C++.  Conversion of the source code requires
only a couple of steps:
	run the converter
	fill in missing type information
Describing this will not take long.  The remainder of the day will be

------------------------------

1993 Andrew Technical Conference and Consortium Annual Meeting
June 24-25, 1993
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA

The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June.  A
tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the
25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the
two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting,
though only Consortium members will be able to vote.

This year's theme is 

	Application Construction by Non-Programmers

Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer
construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent
UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will
consider questions such as
	What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?
	Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?
	Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to
create new widgets?
	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?

Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate
on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including

	applications
	experience with users
	new objects
	reviews of and proposals for revision of 
		internal Andrew protocols

We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would
like to do a demonstration.  

Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.
Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.

Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

A completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie,
Xarchie, is now available as
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z

For those not familar with Archie or Xarchie, I include part of the
manpage intro:

  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information
  system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie
  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the
  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,
  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp
  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows
  you to retrieve files located this way.

Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of
other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the
new features (from the README) follows:

  * Major improvements include:
    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new
      features (FWF MultiList widget).
    - Ability to expand directories in browser.
    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.
    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.
    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable
      pseudo-weights.
    - Online help browser.
    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.
    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.
    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Look up XV_DEPTH.  Also, you might want to try using XView colormap segments
instead of Xlib for your colormap stuff.  They will probably be easier
for you to use, and since you are using a TrueColor visual, you won't
be losing anything compared to straight Xlib.

Hello Motif World,

over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have
been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.

This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will
incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support
X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.

Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this
distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.

Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:

HISTORY

The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,
has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++
classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through
member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library
was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.
However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only
worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no
longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.

I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell 
bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and
enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the
general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).

NEW RELEASE

I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++
bindings. 

This release offers:

- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support
- Support for Xbae widgetset 
- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate
  progress in an application.
- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake
		     and its config files on your site. I have tried to
		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable
		     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely
		     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you
		     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma
		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude
		     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.
- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)
- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted
  on Usenet.

WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS

Ftp:

Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.

Note:

Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large
files during working hours.

Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this
is an old version of the bindings.

E-mail:

Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by
e-mail.

REQUEST

Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please
contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of
bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). 

MORE INFORMATION 

Contact me at ""rvloon@cv.ruu.nl"".

The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section 
of X11R5 included the source to the textedit program.  I'd like to take 
the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message 
server, and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it, since the Sun-supplied
textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk.

However, the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For
example, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview
knows nothing about drag and drop.

The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,
dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says:

        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro

So, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?
I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible.

Please reply by email, and I'll post a summary if there's enough 
interest.

I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms
that certain dialogs, such as ""Column Layout..."" for example, respond
to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog
window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is
POINTER.

How is this done?

I would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a
reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard
action, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the
user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.

Alternatively, I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the ""right""
way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly
when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus
policy is pointer.

Dear Folks:

It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, 
Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library
that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects.

Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the

I don't know if there's a corresponding patch for Solaris 2.1, but this
sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 100492-06, the
Solaris 1.x olwm Jumbo patch:

	1108642 - window system can hang in an errant pointer grab

Actually, I suspect that the OW 3.1 problem may be different, since the
README file says that this patch is just a SunOS 4.x version of the OW 3.1
olwm (but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch, and
they forgot to take it out in the -06 version).

I've used X11R5 with classics set for both 1024x768 and 1152x900 (you

Subject: Standard Colormaps
Organization: MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratories
Lines: 49
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: mtl.mit.edu

I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding 
standard colormaps.

The X11R5 documentation says: ""Usually, a window manager creates 
these colormaps.""  I wonder what window manager the writer had 
in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.

Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  
However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid 
conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard 
colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  
So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very 
problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps 
if every application used standard colormaps, things would 
be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use 
standard colormaps.

Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, 
XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent 
with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.

    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):

    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and 
    base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.  
    To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:

            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF

    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is 
    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c
    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the 
    call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is 
    specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the 
    total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59% 
    of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.
    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation 
    to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.

    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap, 
    defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult, 
    and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3, 
    one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.

    When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1, 
    XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs 
    a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives 
    the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would 
    expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.

I tried to run SoftPC, a PC emulation software program, installed on a Silicon

So, I have the following questions:

1. How do you resolve different font formats from different machines?

2. Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another?

If you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution, please

Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers
would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager
author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and
implemented this at top priority.

The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at
startup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it.

Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps
typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid
displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one
CLUT.

I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible
colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,
colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the
same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a
full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's
called under X11R5).

If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default
colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into
that colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one
hw CLUT framebuffer.

Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your
client, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window
managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?

Subject: Keyboard mapping and window placement questions
Nntp-Posting-Host: fpddet4.mentorg.com
Organization: mentor
Keywords: 
Lines: 27

These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these
specific questions.

1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?
My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a 
modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to
get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that
when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated
(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all 
O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of 
the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier 
requirements.

2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left
sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window 
manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone
who has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move
and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y
and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.

Any help would be most appreciated.

Subject: Save Under with X11R5
Keywords: Save Under, X11R5
Organization: Xelion bv
Lines: 26

I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.

When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.

Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.

When ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly
updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application
gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.

Everything works fine with X11R4.

Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)?
Is it something I do wrong?
Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)?
Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again
I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears
for the second time:

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

PS: I'm working in plain X, using tvtwm.

Dear sun and windows people,

I am running sun workstations with SunOs 4.1.1 and 
vanilla X11 R5. I have a bunch of xterminals as well.

Today I had my xdm fail. At about 9:30
it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal.
The message was the ""xdm too many retransmissions"".
In my xdm-errors file I had the following entries:


  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256
  >error (pid 7927): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be

  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256

Also, at the console, the login box would come up for
about 2 seconds and then
it would go away. It would do this continuously.

I could login from another workstation to the hosts in question,
however, I could not login on the console.

I tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help.
I finally rebooted all the hosts. (Which hurts when done in the
middle of the day).

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Phil

The 4-bit server should work fine.  As far as I know, Xterminals
running older versions can run the latest apps as long as the host 
machine has the R5 libraries installed. I could be wrong though.

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use 
though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you
running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of 
packets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points?

What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these 
images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

Hi,

  I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could 
anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to ""fork"" GDB off as a 
subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program, the 
following happens :

PROGRAM :

	main()
	{
           int x;
 

	   printf(""enter x : "");
           scanf(""%d"", &x);
           printf(""x = .%d.\n"", x );

        }

OUTPUT :

	The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type
in a value (like 5), then all the printf's output comes out at one time.


Is there any other way, besides using PIPES to do this i.e., like ioctl or something else ??

Thanks,

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to
always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the
keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root
window.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have
been pressed.

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString.
You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses
as you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from
the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.

Greetings.

I am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively
create/edit/view a visual ""model"" (i.e. topology) of their network, and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task.

In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other
GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general.

The topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the
topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping, zooming, etc.

I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this.  Specifically, the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming,  if I have
to ""roll my own"".

Suggestions?
