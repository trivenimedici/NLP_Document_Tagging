Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably
includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially
documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.

I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data
structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they
came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they
won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,
there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime
movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac?

My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with
it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she
complains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is
adjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it
objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some
people don't care for it and it is considerably different. 

I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black
vs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is something

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will

The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which 
come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are 
organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is 
the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.

Two.

Both SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does 
nothing for you.

>     .   How fast must they be?

80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.

>     .   Is there any other relevant information?

There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible 
with the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you 
get them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,
it will work in a Q800.

I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of
monitor is connected.  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac
magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).

If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and
forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the
Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software
intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically?

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to
read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.

Here is a simplified way of looking at it:
The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The
second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still
exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last
directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not
taking multiple directories into account.

Subject: Disappointed by La Cie
Organization: Univ of Miami IR
Lines: 52

Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were
intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining
5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.
Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I
then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send
me a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.

I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data
recovery.)

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 

I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)

What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any
other products from La Cie in the future.

Bill Krauthammer
f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu

PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service
has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like
that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and
I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to
this newsgroup.  The ""test"" was the following command:

>Plot3D[((-2*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-5000)^2+(y-8000)^2+
>81000000)^1.5))+((-3*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-10000)^2+
>(y-1000)^2+81000000)^1.5))+((4*2000)/(2*3.1416*
>((x-7000)^2+(y-10000)^2+4000000)^1.5)),
>{x,-5500,19500},{y,-5500,19500},PlotPoints->50]


I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and
workstations.  The results are posted below:

Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. 

Basically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up.  

Well, if you have any questions or if I forgot something, just drop me

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time 
_alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another 
difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I've often used 
memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it's
as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.

Just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or 
were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it?  Also out of 
curiosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as 
I'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on).

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System7.1, had a 14"" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		13.01			6.92
Graf		15.67			7.69
Disk		2.22			2.44
Math		25.57			10.19

P.R. Rating	12.91			6.58

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.

The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX. It is a ROM
upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more
efficient, speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type
Manager 1.0.

That software came out after the original NTXes and the so-called
ATM rasterizer is now standard on Postscript printers.

 My apologies!  I goofed.  The ""quick discharge"" option is part of the

this machine is really fast!  The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but
I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.

However, I still have a few complaints:
- when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop

- the Quantum 170 drive is noisy

Overall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!

The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a
matter of finding one with a long enough shaft to do the trick. 
 
No it is not a good idea to take that fan out.  Why because it will
cause stuff to over heat.  Internal hard drives, motherboard...You name

Frankly, I think this model is a screwup.  It does not have PostScriptlevel
2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have  fine print or photograde, or
grayshare.  Even the 300 model has this!  I am shocked by the kind of

Not Quite the point to be considdered here
Fact If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time

Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper

infact we have a number of times, it ALL comes down to )

  If Apple released this before windows 3.0 was released I'd be behind 
them,
  they missed the boat.  So why is Apple continued development.  Will it
  support the P5 to its fullest capabilities?  Run faster than Windows?  
It
  must do something significantly better than Windows and OS2 to warrent

No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is 
to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't 
happen), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE 
hardware platform.

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the 
temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much 
for Apple (50 million copies  100 is SERIOUS money).

The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep 
in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.
This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless
you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the

If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.

Subject: Adapter Cable for VGA Monitors
Lines: 51

Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to
Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's
160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does
not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into
the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.

Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??

The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming
that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);


Macintosh LC to VGA
 
The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA
monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to
16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported
to 256 colors.
 
Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level
          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work
          with the Macintosh LC.
 
To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable
from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the
pinout description for the adapter cable:
 
Macintosh LC        VGA
Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name
---------------     ----    -----------
1                   6       Red ground
2                   1       Red video signal
5                   2       Green video signal
6                   7       Green ground
9                   3       Blue video signal
13                  8       Blue ground
15                  13      /HSYNC
12                  14      /VSYNC
14                  10      HSYNC ground
7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together
 
VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC
video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which
results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA
monitor.

  I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a 
NuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color 
is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel.

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks. 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the

I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory
upgrade.

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no
greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those
who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi 
or greyscale (at 300dpi).

If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance 
1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).

Regards,

Glenn

P.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  They
really have an obligation to provide this information to all
of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original 
configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for
things like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed, 
I'm going to write Apple and complain.

Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large

it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge

	Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two 
weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) 
appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered
the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.
He wanted to know if that would be ""alright with me""!!!  They must
be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them
with!  

	Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  
Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first
time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been
pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!
	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've
heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get
it swapped.
	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This
wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location
of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for
these functions was much more convenient.
	Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.
I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...
	Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!

This is an aside to Brian Hughes's (please, let's lose the cute phony names

    What phony names? My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I
sing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that,
then you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over
10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7
generally recognize ""Hades"" as my account name. I have no intention of
changing the way I post.

I installed a couple of 16MB SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed
by the general complexity of the operation compared to, for example, the
wonderfully designed LC III. It irritates me when Apple refuses to tell how
to do it in the User's Manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble
the devise in question (it's the same for adding memory to LaserWriter
Pro's).

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.

The operation isn't very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were
offered but Apple leaves you working blind.

    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy
it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no
longer valid.

After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs
came into contact with the plastic case frame. Mine actually contacted the
framework with quite a lot of pressure -- enough so that the assembly of
the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required
some force. I could have filed a little excess material off the top of the
SIMM boards but chose to let it stand as is. I have not had problems with
RAM yet so I will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic.

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just
fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Hope this helps.

I'm interested in getting an external hard drive for my SE/30.  I've
got an internal 40MB that's pretty full, even with compression s/w.  
Alot of people talk about $/MB, what's a good ratio?  I'm thinking of adding
either an 80 or a 100 (or 105).  What brands would people suggest?  Finally,
places to buy from?  Are more popular mail-order places better to order from
or the places that JUST sell hard drives (e.g. ones that advertise in the back
of MacWorld and MacUser).

Thanks in advance.  If e-mail replies are sent, I'll compile them and post
them.

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a ""bad""
experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in
a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return
the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.

Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were
ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me ""Why we never
received your old chips.""  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them, to which the person replied ""You mean you sent them
US Mail?"" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted
to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to
TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)
Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to ""make it right.""

I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking
them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never
buy another product from them again.

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,
but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,
the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this
from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.

Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes
in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.
Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since
they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)

Is that the low-end configuration?  If it is, it has the 68LC040 (no FPU), as  
opposed to all the other configurations with a 68RC040 (has an FPU).  Be sure  
you know what you are getting before you buy!!!  The 68RC040 is around  
$350-$400 right now, if you intend to upgrade it from a 68LC040.

I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA
monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. 
All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work
on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the
sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very
attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I
confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an
LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your
adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a
apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an
IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can
afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

Tell that to the Japanese, their local market is neatly protected by
the Japanese government. Its one very tough nut to crack. In fact
the only current way to break into it, is to do it with a Japanese

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or
SCSI etc. 

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out any more).

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek
reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess
is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.

Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for
mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my
IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me
to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel
betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next
week (heh).

Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait
until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but
you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them
again (grin).

Subject: Axion Serial port switcher: Good or bad?
Organization: Drexel University
Lines: 26

Hi!

   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has
two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound
digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)

   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it
seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)

   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these
things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?

   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you
think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would
like to spend under $140, if possible.

   Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.
If there's interest, I can post a summary of replies.

Thanks a lot!

You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store...
I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary, but a: I'm
in Victoria (B.C., Canada) and b: I don't think an address in Calgary would
help you too much....basically however I just phoned them up, and they
charged me approx. $15 cnd for a custom made ADB extension cable for my mouse.

I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is
supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is
available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since
I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The
CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,
which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the
CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly
lower price with two free CDs.

The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I
think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple
catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo
cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of
which are pretty good.

The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around
$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible
before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's
unless you buy it in a bundle.

Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the
Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's
compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's
speed and performance. 

BTW, the models of the drives are:

Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)

CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it
is also something like with 3401)

NEC:  CDR-74


I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems
whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am
pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.

Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as
the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,
my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is
just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the
enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has
three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and
lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.

Subject: Cannot move data fast enough!?
Summary: disk -> buffer -> network card
Keywords: NuBus, SCSI, disk, throughput
Organization: Gokuraku Videos
Lines: 43

I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec
for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)

I have a Quadra 950. 
I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.
         (using block-mode transfers)
I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can
         achieve 6.8 MB/s.

Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.

It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s
result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)

So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, 

Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.
Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.
Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.
        ...
Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.
Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.

Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,
and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')
each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were
executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.

Why?

Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time.)
Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use
the same bus to mac RAM?

Is there anything I can do?

Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:

""Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?""

Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor
in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much
power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that 040 power in a ""Semi-Portable"" fashion.
By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got ""quadra"" power at your desk.
On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.
Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)
So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical
now...

By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counter-clockwise you can open

it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done.

It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc.  In
a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5.

If they could couple that thought with RocketShare, and let you use both the
'030 on the PB and the '040 on the dock, it would be a mighty powerful dock.

I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's
""MacTools Backup"" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. 
The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect
relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than 
might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.  

Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less
economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools 
is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.

Retrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.

Apples HDSC will only format a hard drive that Apple sold.  You need to use
a third party formater like Drive7 or SpotOn.

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access
time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course,
somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate.

All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment
about drivers.

Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice
feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the
original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning.

If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the
new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at
the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent
with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw
heads.

Sounds about right.

If there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
aggresively cut prices.  Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the
time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can
really hurt your business though :-)

The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing
down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the
only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100,
the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).  I'd bet they'll
be coming out with more power versions too.

Subject: Cache Card and Optimum Memory Settings?
Organization: fnal

NNTP-Posting-Host: phurh.fnal.gov

Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't
rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache?

I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses?

Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.

Hello all.
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.
	I am mostly thinking about a 14"" color monitor and an 8 bit card that
can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-
back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the
Micron Xceed) ?
	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?

Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.

I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards.

I believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse,
you must remove the label on the bottom that says ""Apple Desktop

I haven't tried it myself yet, but when I ran my fingernail
accross the label, these two divots appeared, and I can only assume
that these are the elusive screws in question.

Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD-

I'm assuming that you are referring to the 1304S, correct?  What kind of flaws
have been reported?  I've been using mine for about 6-7 months now, and I
haven't noticed any problems.  Might they develop later, or did I get lucky
and snag a good monitor?

I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and 
apparently Techworks got it.

My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their ""best"" price
because of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality
and installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but 
for out-of-CA purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.

Nope.  I'm pretty sure that this person knows how to take the ball out.
I think that what they want to do is take the mouse apart.  The old mouse
had four screws on the bottom that you could unscrew to do this,
while there's no obvious way to take the new one apart.

Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought
I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).

To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed
from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.
This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some
aluminum foil down to work on.
	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.
	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,
		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.
	3. Remove the flopy drive.
	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting
		the supply straight up and out.
	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom
		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.
	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and
		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then
		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the
		board must be removed first)
	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).
		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.
	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins
		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.
	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 
		them in.
	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.
	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 
		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and
		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a
		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole
		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using
		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat
		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.

	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.
	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will
	    void your warentee.

Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the
system, and lets crash the Mac then.

Okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate
errors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are
masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.

Normally, the ""crash instance"" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and
stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card
crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the
card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.

The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior
when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing
the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy.

So, can anyone help?
Please only reply via email, as I don't read this group.

Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25
per floptical (= $1.20 per megabyte), and I have seen them advertised
in MacWEEK at $20 (< $1.00 per megabyte).  For someone on a tight
budget, the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is
less---$25 versus $60---sometimes matters.

We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual
video problem. 

Model:	610 with 8 MB/230 HD, 512K VRAM, no cards
Monitor:	Apple 16""

When the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done,
particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open
windows).  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Apple
monitor with 256 colors is used. 

I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.  The problem has
been apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse.

We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, how
to fix it.  Please also respond to azelenet@bigmac.mskcc.org.  Thank you
for your help.

There's this old SE here. It's got the older-style fans that remind
me of a house-ventilator. A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor
I usually see. Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise due
to vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the front
from the back, it quiets down. I can only assume that the fan housing
from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating
against it. 

Anyway, any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to
""stealth"" this guy? Your experiences welcome.....

	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong. It would be an
extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available
Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat. In
fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
sinks.
	Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead
of a deal with DEC.

I have a chance to buy a used PS/2 Appletalk card to create a network with
my home machines.  However, the guy who has the card tells me there's a
DB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than
the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect.  This sounds more like a
Thicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on the
Quadras?  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of
these cards, keeping in mind that it's Micro-Channel Architecture, which
means take your best guess and double it.
Email replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.com

The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it
at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above
the minimally guaranteed figure.

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.            Like most things, you get what you pay.  That's the deal.

This problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.

Yes, but if you upgrade the VRAM in a 900 you get 24 bit color.  So
you really don't care.  My point is that out the box the 950 has
more video capability for the same size monitors.  The 900 can
do 24 bit with both 13"" and 16"", doesn't support 19"", and
does 8 bit on 21"" monitors.

  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure).
  Ethertalk card on-board
  Audio in/out
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots.
  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.

In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more.

Sorry about the misinformation.  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous
post.  About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it?  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad.  Like it needed a filter or something.
Much worse than I expected.  I installed the CD-300 in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something.  Everything else
works great though.

I bought a Bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of

OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli.

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev

alot. you ran out of storage real fast.

IMHO, the best buy currently is the Bernoulli 150Multidisk. 150MB per cartridge

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some
purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).


Otherwise the other possibilities would be:

1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial
port on mac, collect data with some communications program.

2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to
a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition
(nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)

3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega,
etal.  The finest solution, but possibly the most costly.



To the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not
use a voltage divider? Two resistors, cost very cheap...

Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in
several FAQs but couldn't really find anything.

I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want
(need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget.
I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is
the best (performance wise) and most economical way
to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,
4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
and use the rest of what I already have?  The manual
hasn't been very helpful with this.

Thanks.

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!
I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price
was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I
tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a
resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard
number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could
not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA
over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT
EMPTOR.

However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist
- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably
get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order
out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains
to be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out
an educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO
include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!

of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser 
used.  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 68040

A professor of mine once said ""The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about $5000"" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than
the CS.
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the ""computer"" in your
car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.

P.S. The $5000 is not just a joke

The service notice on the 13"" hi-res monitors expired 3/23/93 after this  
date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix (replacement  
of the hi-voltage capacitor). All you folks that have been putting up with  
intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
out on the freebie. It was in force for a year. If you got it free after  
3/23, you got a deal...

Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared
for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup
section says Apple 14"" and 16"" monitors can go on top, but 21"" and other
big ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load?

Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the ""partition"" button
on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly.  The ""getting more information"" section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net.

Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.

I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.

Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.  As a result mail order
companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.

This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have
more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs
by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better
wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial
nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.

You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.

I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices
thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer
cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs
and trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well. 
The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest
prices available from authorised local dealers.

They are even further away from educational prices.

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My
needs
are much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with 
different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine.

Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed
jobs is
very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder, as some do).

(I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.)

An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE/30 is that,
just as with the '030 power cache, the '040 accelerator will plug into
the CPU socket, leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet
card.  With DayStar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation.

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting

I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived
here. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast.

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many
cases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in
the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per
seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit
convertor is more then sufficient.

AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases
you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled
also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If
the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly
distorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the
occurrence of the spike that is important. 

However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start
battling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were
to start looking for the technical specifications.

Ben,

Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works,
the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough
cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of
the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their
stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different
position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of
contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing
the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the
ball, not the center cylindrical area.

I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but
needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our
office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one
could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might
help.

I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If
you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl 
alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.

If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see
if it is actually causing the axle to spin. 

If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(
It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be
necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that
dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Hope this helps,

Murray

I have the same problem and was about to post this....

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)
 
I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from
sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second
time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a
corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of
the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
(no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1
etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC.
I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).
 
What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or
hardware ? 
 
If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and
waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour (and let Apple know too !).
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.
 
Bruce

Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad
sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII
supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference? 
Apparently! :)

Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and
the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far
as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up
to 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.

Noooooooo!  I've been servicing Macs for years too, and I've had to
repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way.  It's
rare, but it does happen.

Mind you, this doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  The parts that can
blow (the ADB power fuse and RF filter) aren't too expensive, so IF you
have a someone around who can do component-level repair, it may be worth
the risk (especially if you're around Seattle, 'cause you might get to
pay *me* to fix it :-))..  On the other hand, if your only repair option
is the Apple-standard logic board swap (major $$$$), you should probably
play it safe.

Here is the problem:  When the screen is tilted too far back, vertical

to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.
It looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection

The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than
Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.

>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only
>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet

That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire
(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240
all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly
remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.

My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:

(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add
    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going
    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.
    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it
    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).

(2) On the Mac side, you will need:
    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).
    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).
    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be
      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).
    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      self-terminated or not.
    - configure MacTCP to use ""Ethernet"".

(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:
    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.
    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).
    - get a 25ohm terminator.

Your two-machine network will look like this:

For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is
also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think). 

In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For
that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector, but sacrifice portability.

Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you
want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
light wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right.

well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus

me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .

With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:

1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns
VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)

2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing
would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)

Just wondering....

Hi all,  

I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad (and might just be out
of alignment, I haven't checked yet. :-))  If the drive is not easily
reparable, I'd like to replace it with an _internal_ floptical.  Can this
be easily done?  Can it be done at all?  

I'm assuming that floptical drives can read and write both 800k and 1.4k
floppies.  If this is not in fact true, please tell me.

Thanks in advance,

Yes! what you are saying is absolutey true, but what you fail to mention is the
fact that the LCIII uses the new 72 pin simms which allow 32 bit access to
each simm. In the case of the LC III, it only has one simm slot, but accesses will
be 32 bits wides.

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good
advice.

We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk,
and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB
disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some
problems:

The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?

Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them
installed in the other disk.

The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.

It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.

Thank you!

This doesn't sound right to me.  Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the
chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt
synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.

Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra.
On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip.

Subject: Disappearing hard drive in LC?
Organization: CONCERT-CONNECT -- Public Access UNIX
Lines: 31

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to
hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system
7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated
chain.

I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes
have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking
question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed
okay, but there was no sign of the internal.

I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot
from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire
about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in
trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it
is a Quantum... )

Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I
noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that
all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.

But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD
or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.

And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I
can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed
there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and
that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.

Thanks for answers.

Ravi,

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position.  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   
I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  
why take that chance?  If you want more detailed info on the problem, please

Sunny,

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on 
it's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I 
trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the 
least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I 
don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S 
internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.

I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0,

and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size
requirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have 40pnt definition

Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely
works with System7.  However, the upgrade was US$40, so I
passed.

Hope this helps?

I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.  I had to get
rid of my ""venerable"" Bernoulli 20 last year (with enough 
cartridges purchased at ~$90 each to make the whole thing 
worth more than my whole computer ;).  The tech support guys
at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers 
might fix the problem - in my case the cartridges wouldn't 
format/mount/partition for A/UX.

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset
of the 68851's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy
bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will
be the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same
size, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump'
in the middle of it.


Example:


                         -----------
                        /           \
         ---------------             ---------------
         |                                         |
         |                                         |

That and the Apple logo should make it easy to find.

When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I
believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection.  It comes with instruction for
installation and requires no soldering.  Worked like a charm.  I think the
manufacturer is Mobius.

Well, I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed:

	One ""socket"" for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One ""socket"" for a 72-pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flat-pack FPU

	A processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit

That's it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS, but that's the only place.

 With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and

 60ns 72 pin simms.
 
 2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the

 would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
 board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)
 
 2 configs: 4mb & 8mb. In each case the memory is soldered on the board
 leaving the 4 simm sockets open. 132mb is the total addressable memory for a
 650.

According to the (seen several times) postings from Dale Adams of Apple
Computer, both the 610 and the 650 require 80ns SIMMS - NOT 60 ns.  Only
the Centris 800 requires 60 ns SIMMs.

The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other
types of partitions. It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac
volume. You need SilverLining or something similar to do that. It WILL,
however, allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your
hard disk, if you don't mind reformatting the whole thing.

Apple doesn't make such a card, though I suppose a third party could.  One
big problem is that there isn't room for a standard NuBus card inside the
LC III.

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed. 
I don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select.  I

I like it a lot. It is worth the additional expense. The only problem I
found is with MS Word (5.1a). If you have a table the is longer than
a page and the cells have a visible border, the last (bottom of page)
line on the first page will be missing. It makes no difference how
the table is formatted. The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's
page view or page preview.

Dynamic RAM is not based on flip-flops; there's basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit!  Static RAM is based on
flip-flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense.  And
neither has any parts that ""move"", if electrons and thermal expansion
are ignored...

Subject: updated keyboard question for the plus
Organization: Illinois State University
Lines: 44

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .
 
one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the
newer models are different from the connection used on the plus---
you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus
and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in
other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.
it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.
 
omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution
so others can, too. thanx for the input.

I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in
the next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few
different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different
speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when
I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any
compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able
to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch
without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed
and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further
reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course
I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch
but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and
route it directly to the mother board.

I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the
voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?  

Thanks.

""tell"" with internal drives?  
	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I
didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's

the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21""
with 8 bit depth and up to 16"" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator.

Hi there,


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers.

On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16"" monitor, which is capable of
32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?
On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16"" monitor, which is capable
of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that
both machines have 16-bit color capability.
Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
16-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?


Thanks for your help!

Subject: HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx
Keywords: SCSI, IIfx
Organization: NASA Ames Research Center 
Lines: 46

I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old
and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for
two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining
5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.
The error message reported was like:

Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.

This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the
diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after
reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes
2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,
but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall
System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,
I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:

   o Frequent crashes
   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to
       correct.
   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.
       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the
         disk either.
       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes
         requires several attempts.

QUESTIONS:

   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?
   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard
      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some
      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?
   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest
      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the
      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx
      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal
      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with
      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).
      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;
      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of
      course who knows :-<

Help would be much appreciated.

Check out the National Instruments NB-DSP2300. This uses the Texas
Instruments TMS320C30 chip, which is a true 32 bit floating point DSP. It's
pricey, however.

I don't know about the Instrutech boards (though I plan to check them out),
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S/N ratio of
many of the ""16 bit"" boards out there. The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity, S/N ratio, accuracy, etc; and the
NB-A2100 and NB-A2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that you'd expect from a good, true 16 bit converter. This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example.

Ah, but why?  Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the
difference is between PDS and Nubus?  

Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
Nubus card cage?  At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive

drives, namely 1/3 ht LPS drives that have a smaller platter and are also
more stable.

So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it 
require a logic board swap? It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I 
guess that's getting a bit fantastic!

I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card.

Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the 
estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true.

Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it 
advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's
at all *interesting*.

------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------

You've heard about Apple's great new customer ""support"" program.  Well,
think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple
computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:

In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort
by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with
certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice ""stick"" in
the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the
machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the
reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of
BCGA65431. You'll recognize this ""sticky button"" symptom immediately if you
have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.

Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead 
suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly
(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described
my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told
Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of
warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering
where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the
serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)
range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.

Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make
it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.
Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you
know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start
hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.
Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:

                  United States      1-800-776-2333
                  Canada             800-665-2775
                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01
                  Australia          61-2-452-8000
                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500

If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask
for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register
the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.

Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user
bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to
me or post yet another ""sticky-button"" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If
enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple
will eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy
to stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the
next, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.

Reply-To: jartsu@vipunen.hut.fi

Hello all!

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D
(predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac
IIvi.

With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra
video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not
to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.

But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating
Apple 13"" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local
distributor of NEC.
With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of
the time or every now and then.
But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows
etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts
sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some
""spiky"" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing
pull-downs etc.
With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only
sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a
picture clear enough to shut down from menu...
With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but
sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely
lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.

I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but
with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?

I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can,
at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin
assignment for NEC 3D.
I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and
isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be
arranged, especially syncs and groundings.

Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works
perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and
also Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.

Here are the pinouts & stuff:

15 pin mini D-sub (NEC 3D)		15 pin D-sub (Mac, at least Quadra)

1  Red Video				1  Red GND
2  Green Video				2  Red Video

Keywords: Mac IIcx, internal, hard disk drive, SCSI

Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI 
accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,
New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives.

It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher

 speeds. There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but
if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy

clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its
floppy drive.

On a serious note, I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures.  But I

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:

Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16"" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.

My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

if you have a memory card installed that's not one of apple's, this
may be the problem.  for a couple of months after the release of
the duo, some memory manufacturers were shipping duo memory cards w/
improper (non-self-refreshing) chips.  if you have a third party 
card, pull it and see if the sleep problem recurs.

You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings
I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the
details, but the gist was that there are going to be no
third-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please
correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have
two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
screen.
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within
driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction.
 
Details:
 
Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
---------------------------------------------------
 
**SOLD**
 
Sony 1304 14"" color monitor:
----------------------------
What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,
Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).
It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,
and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
 
Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not
including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable.
 
 
RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13""
monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode
(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a
RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg
SIMMS).
 
Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking
**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and
packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a ""bundled offer""
for these items.
 
------------
 
Cheers.

The IIIP has just been superseded by the 4M, which is the one I am using at

down.  In Australia the price of the 4M is about comparable with that of the

I have no experience with this particular hardware, but
just about every month in Macworld there is an add for
an combined SE accelerator/Video board.  This item sells
for about $1000 and comes with a 25MHz 68030/68882 pair,
eight SIMM slots, and a grayscale 21"" monitor.

This accelerator plugs into the SE's lone expansion port
and thus no soldering.  You will however, need a long
TORX wrench to get the case open (but that's not really
a big deal).

Does that sound like what you were looking for?

According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator
can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus.
Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI
problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three
devices, fourth one causes major problems).

First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.
If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine
then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this 
fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.

Hope this helps.

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.

(Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive...)

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there
is no problem building an expansion box.

The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface
with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work
together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:
here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with
this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You
may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2
video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra 
electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so
guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.

You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put
it at a convenient number like ""1"".  You *could* cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the
hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive.

Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM
SIMMs, though.

You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer.  The relevant parts are:

  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate
  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25"" device mounting bracket]

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to
mount a 5.25"" device.  The service techs I talked to said, ""Oh sure,
we stock those.""  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 5.25"" device.  (Why not?  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
5.25"" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for
their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive, which is a standard 5.25"" device.

Good luck with your SyQuest.

If Apple didn't put out such a good product -- I'd gladly take my

I've had mine on order since January.  Apple finally called me last

In the meantime, I've been stuck with my Duo210 without the
connectability I needed it for.  I'm sure there are plenty of people
who can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is
right or at least justified, but I'm just a crabby consumer and

A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs
or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory
(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder
comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or
sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and
so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods
mentioned above).

Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information:

Physical RAM size: 20480K.
Logical RAM size: 20480K.

Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?
How can I turn this on?  Any ideas?

Hello Mr. Au,

I have to disagree regarding your assessment of Macintosh in Hong Kong. The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin


e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.

Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.

Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  Some highlights are...
32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers 
& 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8K copyback capable caches,
4-way set associative.  Typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5
clocks for a floating point multiply.

(interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point
numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)

>2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...

More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.  Figure
about 0.8 clocks per instruction typical (my guess).  But the Motorola
guys are pretty bright, it may be less.

Call Motorola.  I'm not typing it all in.

>I am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people.

I'm predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their
ends.  New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can
schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort
of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.

I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly
impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to
speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get
that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch
target buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors.
Big whoop.  Designing a 100MHz board is difficult and really
expensive.  Priced 15ns memory chips lately?

060 fastest, then Pentium, with the first versions of the PowerPC

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If
you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but
it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.

And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the 68030.

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I
came up with:
ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.
Quick summary of each commmand:
Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.
L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)
&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on
S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)

In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right
before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer 
function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra
14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.

In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed
the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and
everything seems to work fine.

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward
this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and
also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something
to add, feel free.

Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from
Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,
and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in 
thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering
and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.

My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general?
Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this
a rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience
in this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of
experience.

That's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary.
Thanks all.

Here is the story:
I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an
Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.

Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do
the trick.

Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that
there aren't going to be any.

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...

thanks in advance.

	Hello,

	I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World]
a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be
used to ""recycle your old SIMMs,"" when you upgraded memory.  I don't
remember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised in
any of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software
to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS 
he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly
good idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  
Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one
if they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please
e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.

I can't say for sure with the IIvx -> C650 upgrade, but I wondered the
same thing when I ordered my LC -> LC III upgrade.  Turns out the ""upgrade""
is actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives.  You pull the floppy and
hard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you've got
an LC III.

The IIvx -> C650 may be the same thing.

It might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that
Apple only sells Macs pre-packaged with the drives.  Of course, the price

Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S?

I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16"" mode, the
picture won't
go very big. I end up with about 1"" gap either side, and .5"" top &
bottom. I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it?

Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked.
This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not
visible, the
real image virtually disappears!

The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too
much!

Oh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:
 
Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16"" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
 
I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.
 
My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system

Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM
expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to
the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion,
giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling
TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....

For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk.  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
use.  Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers
upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were

To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information
already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:

A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to
200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed
inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the
same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate
must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits
at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national
Instruments, at the same sample rate.

D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of
the 4 output channels has its own converter.

The price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface
board (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695. Rather
steep.

	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The
processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is
pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
to increase speed among other things.

	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without 
giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when 
you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.
Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to 
its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?

	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is
based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a
processor to speed it up.  

	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure
processor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work
well and another will not based on its design, then we can get
somewhere with our discussions.

Not a good idea to compare processor power. Doesn't make sense for real

At least for x86 systems doubling the clock speed increases performance
by about 70% .

Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola ""equivalents""
although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
is something that is highly debatable.

How about some numbers here? Some kind of benchmark?
If you want, let me start it - 486DX2-66 - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 .

Numbers? Pentium @66MHz - 65 SPECint92, 57 SPECfp92 .
	 PowerPC @66MHz - 50 SPECint92, 80 SPECfp92 . (Note this is the 601)
        (Alpha @150MHz  - 74 SPECint92,126 SPECfp92 - just for comparison)

Not in a clock-doubled system. There isn't a doubling in performance, but
it _is_ quite significant. Maybe about a 70% increase in performance.

Besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. I mean,
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns SIMMs? Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 MHz.

	Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it.  

	In my five years of education in this field, though brief 
compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her/his
sophamore year.                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you
are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. 
If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

Lines: 69
NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu
Summary: Instructions for Quadra 700 memory installation
Keywords: memory,quadra,700,install

This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me
included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and
started to experience these problems.

Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of
potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware
(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power
manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.

None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe
(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I
have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears
to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on
startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is
being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any
non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be
reset by ""holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up"" -
Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button
I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if
someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.

Beyond this Apple suggest that "" you should follow the technical
procedures to check the hardware of this Duo"". Since so many others
appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there
has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -
and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230
purchasers who have this problem.

Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,
particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)

But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at
200 MHz.

>>680040
>>486

>As far as the 486DX2-66 goes - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 .

But the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 MHz version,
making it ""comparable"" to a 486DX2-80

I think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction
is 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem.

Subject: Asante EN/SC hangs SCSI devices
Reply-To: behr@math.ilstu.edu (Eric Behr)
Organization: Central Illinois Surfing Club
Lines: 31

I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC
adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the
newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.

The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -
specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac
tests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, the
power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use
the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the
Asante box pretty much unusable.

It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn
on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed
during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter
works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has
*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had
it for over a year).

Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --
several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the
head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator
(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal
resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another
identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?
Thanks a lot.    E.

Applied Engineering makes a NuBus card called the QuadraLink which is 
a board that contains 4 serial ports, which I believe can be used
simultaneously.  I'm not a user of one of these, but I have installed

I have ordered several Macs from different mail order companies with absolutely zero problem. You have to dig around to find the true gray market dealers that sell Macs with authentic serial numbers untouched. There are value-added dealers (nothing to do with VAT, no flame please) that are very legitimate.

CDA unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent Apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to CDA.

How do you calculate that figure? I'd assume even in personal computers

Hi,

The subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.

This was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my
drive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive.

I'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad
software, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80)
just a screwey drive?

Thanks,

Chuck

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in
a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't
use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).

If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with
a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  My 
understanding is that the ""optional fpu"" refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system
(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.
Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY
comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU -
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

Hope that helps.

This can be caused by two one of two things.  The first and easiest to fix is
interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or
other electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix
that problem.

Second, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with
room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off
all lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not,
try moving the system somewhere else.

A third solution would be to get a 14"" Apple Color Display - It should not
have the same problem the 12"" Color is more suceptible to.

You can try calling Apple's new support number (in the U.S.) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE.
This number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and
compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday,
April 5, 1993.

How many NuBus slots do you have?

Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is
a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms
toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with
software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they
think they open a built-in port.

They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance)
and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles
8 ports simultaneously.

As I said, with NuBus, you're green. Learn how to use the Comms
Resource Manager to get at the various installed cards.

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. 

Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I
noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
capability refer to the ""auto inkjet"" feature. This should have read ""auto
inject"" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from
Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess
that someone edited the copy, saw ""inject"" and thought it was a typo and
changed it to the more familiar word ""inkjet"".

Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of
*writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

   My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it.
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad

   I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac.
   I checked my video card, it's also fine.
   I replaced all the RAMs, it still didn't give me right answer.
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.

Hi.  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra
900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem
on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be
greatly appreciated.

When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types
of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH
speakers:

system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)

Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho!


But, the following games only play out of the left channel:

Lemmings
Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
Glider 4.0
OIDS


But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.
(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))


All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run
OOTW because he doesn't have color).

We're both running system 7.1



Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get
sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or
greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?

I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in
stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be
mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB
170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there
isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are
apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?

Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),
so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1
patch over this problem?)




Thanks for any help you can provide!

I had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago.  Resoldering
the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it.  Turns out
that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)
cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video
circuitry off.  If you're not a solder-jockey you might want to
have someone else do it -- I took mine to an electrical engineer
buddy -- but it was a 20-minute job, tops.

Bad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple
Macintosh PowerBook Duos) 
MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.

COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993

By Raines Cohen

     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook
Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss
and other problems.

     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week
issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM
products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.
Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.

     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called
selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But
Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with
nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to
wake from sleep.

     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part
number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips
instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may
not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses
nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed
while the Duo sleeps.

     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo
cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology
Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are
certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.

     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers
Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is
compatible with the slower chips.

     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that
some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner
of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally
when in a Duo Dock.

     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it
originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all
customers free upgrades to cards that fit.

Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and
mix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while
some are ""truly"" mono (like the LC)

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard, while the right channel isn't. Some
send data to both, some only send data to the left channel
(the first is preferrable, of course)

I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230
([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems.
Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During
this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away
(For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
configuration.

He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these
have helped. 

It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his
email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this
problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time). 

Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest
unless I know that might *really* be the problem. 

He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.

Anyone who has ideas, I'd love to hear about them. I'd call Apple, but
I've found they're best to call during the week (it's Sunday evening).

	I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print 
some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that
grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are
using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu.
You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple
rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems
that SE ROMs won't support those ""features"". Okay, I 
guess I should have somehow known that this was the case.
Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?
	Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the 
problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the 
ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living
(on unix platforms) and I don't understand the ""it just
can't be done"" responses I've gotten from those I have
asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-
ware, just such a fix. 
	Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable
about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply
impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could
someone armed with enough info and a little pro-
gramming experience cook something up that would
supplement the ROM's capabilities?
	Also, how does one know if one's mac can
support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300
is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer
and trying it out like I did)

It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the
disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible
with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written
Is that correct?

To use the grayscale features, I believe you need a Mac equipped
with colour quickdraw. I was told this somewhere or other, but it's
not mentioned in ""Apple Facts"" (guide for apple sellers), in the

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at
least three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610. They have not, to
my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could
make one, technologically.

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs.

Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS
adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted,
there are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a
NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an
LC/LCII/LCIII anyway.

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded
with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to 
serial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX
handheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs
on two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by 
design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when 
connected to the printer port.  

Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you 
tried using the printer port?

Good luck.

Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based
Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and
the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,
NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.

Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except
perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC
slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC
accelerators.

One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will
need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with
Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.

Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs
will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC
and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in
existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking
prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen
much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.

First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed
CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.
This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled
for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which
I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do
this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as
standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where
Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup
is in order.

By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,
Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor
front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.
Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all
the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent
right now.

Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market
position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially
if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it
might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome
battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not
guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of
several.

The DayStar PowerCache for the SE/30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated
CPU plus the powercache.  This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card.
Currenty, DayStar does not have the '040 in this configuration, but it is
due out early next year.  With their upgrade policy, you can get the '030
accelerator now, and when the '040 version becomes available, you get
credit
for the one you have.  

I am running their 50 MHz version with FPU along with a Radius Precision
Color Pivot and I'm very satisfied.

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac.
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with
the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable
(depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC

Organization: The MacInteresteds of Nashville, Tn.
Lines: 37

Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the 
Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:
(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes
(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 
running at 15.87 Mhz.
(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a 
lot of memory.
(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors 
that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors 
sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell 
memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most 
memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether 
the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine 
California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - 
$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that 
are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.
(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an 
average access time of about 25 ms.
(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a 
backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move 
your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or 
non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.

Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay 
for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to 
sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about 
$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for 
about $900. 

The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got 
one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright

Dear Netters,

My sister has an Apple 12"" Color Display hooked up to an LC.

Problem:  There is an annoying, horizontal, ghost-like stripe that 
precesses vertically about once per second.  It is about 1 cm high.
She is in grave danger of going insane because of it.

Any ideas of what it might be and how I might cure it for her?

PS: if I pick up the display (I thought it might be RFI from the LC) it 
seems to get worse!

If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has
a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time
without losing memory)

It is also compatible with the chat program ""FishBomb"" which allows
sounds and pictures as well.

Both are, as far as I know, freeware (I dustribute Zing with source)
and should be available on the normal services (mac.archive.umich.edu
for instance)

Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size
of Zterm via ResEdit. He did not tell me HOW I could change it using
ResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.

Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?

I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and
I have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct
resource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around
a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port.
(other than Appletalk).

BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is
3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are
using hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo,
and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond
3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me.

Reply-To: petrack@vnet.IBM.COM
Disclaimer: This posting may contain no views at all
News-Software: Usenet 3.1
Lines: 45

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection
between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on
the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on
the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware
ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing
has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.

In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides
are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the
PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.
When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.
I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the
transmission is error free.
But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.
Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human
typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).

I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files
from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please
tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am
talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some
kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.

Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because
of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds
because of some crazy reason I don't understand.

Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information
out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a
sys-ex dump?

Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.
I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,
or just me.

Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type
back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking
and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,
According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

Please help me figure out what's going on...

All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
Mac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumed
the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying ""This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware""

This problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing....
Thanks to one very adventurous USENET reader (sorry I can't remember the
guy's name!  Somebody please post it....he deserves the credit for saving
us all $$$$$) it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem......


Best I can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs in
the power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuit
card.  Go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and some
good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit
card with the AC plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to do
it for you.  It took me less then 10 minutes and saved me at least $300 for
a new supply!

I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
in my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13"" monitor. What's
the deal on them?

1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max
and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?

2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?

3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that
modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What
bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some
applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly
to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?
How much slower is it?

4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was
incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,
or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other
apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-
Microsloth) apps, for example)?

5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,
let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

Thanks a lot for you input.

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs.
I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal
bug has crept into their more recent s/w. The bug only shows up during
heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (MacsBug can not
reboot, time to hit the restart button).

AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug
which I described to them. Since then they have not answered any of my
faxes asking them for a status of the bug-fix.

The QL has been great, but for now I have mine sidelined. If you are only
going to be using 2400 Baud or less, then you may have no, or very
infrequent problems,

    To display Millions of colors on a 16"" monitor you need 2MB of VRAM

    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes
with.

    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only
knows 1MB and 2MB.

>From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
>16-bit color, is that correct?

    Yes, this is correct. You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800's motherboard.

>Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they

    Yup. You have to take off the power supply. It's only a couple of

    If you mean in a ""newer, more powerful"" Mac system then the answer
is no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and
no longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.

    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are
two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.

    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with
an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU.

>>Why say ""optional"" if it's built in?

    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.

>If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with

    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.

>Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
>system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system

    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full
040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.

>Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY

    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated
countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware
designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that
the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no ""option"" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an ""option.""
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.

  What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRoute/TCP made by
Compatable Systems ($1400).  This will allow you to connect your Localtalk
network (4 Macs) to your Ethernet network (NeXT and Ethernet Mac).  It will
route TCP/IP protocol between the two networks.  Software routers are also
available for less money, but I'm not sure if they work with TCP/IP.

Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to
ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a
marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at
this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a ""full page"" monitor
for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed
by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook
screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you
would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,
technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen
and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR ""full"" height. 
The screen would probably be monochrome.
The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very
popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word
processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient
to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and
applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could
hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really
need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me
via email and let me know:
1. If you would consider buying a ""full page"" laptop screen
2. How much you would be willing to pay for it
3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea

Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,
but who knows!), please send me some.

Dear Mac-friends,

I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines
all with 17 Mb RAM installed (70 or 80 ns SIMMs).

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
on the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and
have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they
are a few millimeters apart).
I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,
especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.
Applications which produce this effect are:
- the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2)
- Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU

The machines use their built-in video and drive the old 
Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  
The effect is independent of the settings in the following control 
panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache) 
        and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).

Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the

The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem, it was heavily
discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's (at least the
700
and 900).  System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the 
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my
case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
Quadra
700, all that occured early last year.

NuBus is a much more robust system for system for installing multiple

I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought

I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I
originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.

Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the ""no disk to boot from"" icon.  However, upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  
Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power
off and on always works.

This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed?

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
""come up to speed"" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD?

Thanks!

I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple
printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:

Required features:

- PostScript

- 300 dpi

- emough memory to download fonts

- The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.


Nice things:

- anything over 4 pages per minute

- scsi output for a font disk

- smallish footprint



Don't Care About:

- PostScript Level II

- networking (its just for me, and always will be)

- color


I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow.
I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going
to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's
experience with it, tho. 

I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in
my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot
and the first to admit it. :)


I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The
page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and
maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to
be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.


Printers I've been looking at:


- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that
  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?

- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee
  discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably
  cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning
  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.

- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't
  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a ""postscript upgrade.""
  ??

- Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and
  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?

- I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.
  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),
  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.


Thanks for any comments...

Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was
because
of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by
scanning
this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines).

When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to
generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant ""I
want to
play a mono sound"" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound.

Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.

Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware,
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works.
On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra
700/900/950
at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only.
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification,
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.

If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono
sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their
games will only come out the left on some games.

The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which
are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what
machine
you have.

Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:
>Lemmings
>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
>Glider 4.0
>OIDS
and also
Hellcats,
Super Tetris
Oxyd
(and many more, these are just what I've tested)

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.


Other games you list:
>Armor Alley
>Spectre
>Spaceward Ho!
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
(and more, these are again only from personal experience)

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.

The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!
Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do,
but I'm going say it anyway.
Stop cheating on sound!
Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period
is about to end.
The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon, so use it.

In conclusion:
To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.
To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of
automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all
hardware.


Have fun.

Disclaimer number 1:
I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.
So don't write me with sound questions.

Disclaimer number 2:
If it says up above that I wrote anything like ""the grace period is about
to end"" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not
allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new
wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print
GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer
(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not
possible).

This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to
Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It
is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.

SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour
version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the
'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it
gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).

There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older
computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been
upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal
with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult 
time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).

Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT
Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to
do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300
is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is
the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800
upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal

SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.

Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three
contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the
biggest ""cult following"", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any
tweaking.

The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are
backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in
effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &
all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order
directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and
they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;
it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for $190.

All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a
Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how
it works in two weeks or so.

Thanks, Steve, for your helpful and informative comments on Mac stereo
sound.

Too bad some developers aren't addressing the problem.

This did make my trusty old Mac II superior to the Quadra I replaced
it with in one way though!  :)

I think you are suffering from some alignment or color
table or <whatever> problems, if a Color Classic is as fast
as a Quadra rendering to screen.

What screen card you use does of course matter much (built-in
video is almost always faster than NuBus)

Or you measured ""scroll entire screen"" where the Color Classic
had a VRAM 10"" screen in 4-bit color and the Quadra had a
21"" 24-bit screen on NuBus :-)

Lines: 21

Jeff,
  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony
CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14"" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it
takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half
a year and I love it.  
Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a
Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons
why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only
complaint was that they did not always return my calls.  
I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's
(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.

The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC?  I
recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7.  I don't know if that is
true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.

Subject: Can I remove the 68000 under my daughterboard upgrade?
Organization: Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.
Lines: 26

The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:

I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the
equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).

The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has
a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an
entirely easy thing to do) and clean the ""legs"" of the 68000.
Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
snap on upgrades:  the 68000's ""legs"" will oxidize, causing 
unusual system errors.

Well, that's me.

So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be
fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and
modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of
is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't
acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.

Will someone provide the extra 3%?

When she tries to print it on a IIg the pi changes to an upside down
caret, and several other symbols change to double quotes at bottom of

instead of spaces.

This happens on a IIg laser printer.  Tried it on serveral macs and two

Organization: University of Tasmania, Australia.

	The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware,
read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume
setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and
wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.


If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device,
or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is
possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 
'sad mac' sound.


This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.
If you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel
there is something incorrect with the logic board. 

My Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having.

well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after

new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...

i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch
of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:

* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook
introductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an
appearence ""this summer"" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i
don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had
more info...

* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the
ones the duo's just went through recently?

* what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing
a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have
a feel for how much ""better"" the display is (yea, it looks great in the
store, but is that all ""wow"" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit
some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth
taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize
this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the
machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody
who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).

* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)

thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a

I have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5"" MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. 
No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Good luck.

of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20
buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:

I put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that
the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still
lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?
Do you have to do something to activate them?
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?

BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.

  Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the
PowerLink DeskNet. The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, 
including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port
and a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.
  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of
these have an FPU.
  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes
me now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and ""Quadra"" comparable
video speed. No idea if it has an FPU.
  Hope this helps...

I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).
It is a 3.5"" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest
drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the 
drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures
are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of
performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC
and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the 
differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according
to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak
including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI
and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands
are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 
105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli
drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more
reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
getting my hands on one.

OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)
Mac
 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal 
representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment 
of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly.

IBM
 Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when 
emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this 
better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, 
Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.

Networking [Includes printing]
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.
Mac
Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for 
each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a 
network option since 1989.
Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can 
use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, 
Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing 
machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows 
typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version 
will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 
(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software 
built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.
Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.
 {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}

IBM  
Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.
Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk 
protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.
Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible 
with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to 
that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, 
{80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and 
offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more 
complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)
Printing {Very OS dependent}
DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
 and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next.
Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing ""jobs"" 
 in the print queue, but it always lists printers as ""active""... even if they 
 are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like 
 and intelligent about this.
OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.
Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved.

Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features 
than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds.
The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  
built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and 
NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.
All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where 
noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card 
needed except for 24-bit color display}.
IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA 
monitor {VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, 
sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 
16-bit color, etc}.
Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {386sx/20MHz 
equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.
LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.
Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program 486sx/40 or 
'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a 
PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.
Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program 486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 
MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; 
$3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit

hat the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
Mac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumed
the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying ""This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware""
even though there was no cartridge in the drive.

t to format) I have this confirmed from Apple Computer in Sweden (I work for a Apple dealer as a service tech). We had problems that Quadras wanted to format a diskette or a Syquest when ther was nothing in the drive. This problem was fixed sytem 7.1

The point being the processor speed is only one of many aspects of a
computers performance.  Clock speed, processor, memory speed, CPU
architecture, I/O systems, even the application program all contribute 
to the overall system performance.

the Q700 will only do 8bit or 24bit color.  if you want the higher

for a 21"" monitor, you can get 8bit max.

I have had my Q700 running with a 66.666 MHz osc for a few months. I have a
number of SCSI devices connected (Quantum LP52, Maxtor 213, Toshiba MK156F via
Emulex adapter, Pioneer DRM-600) and have had no trouble.

I am using the stock cooling facilities, I considered adding a fan/heat pump,
but don't feel they are necessary (for my box anyway). I have a temp meter on
order and plan to do some measurements when it arrives in a few weeks. Email me
if you want to see the results.

HELP!

	I just received my Falcon 2.2.1 upgrade from Spectrum Holobyte today.
My SE is running Sys 7.0.1 with 4mb of RAM. Like the instructions said, I only
installed Disk 2 (The program...no start up screen or music).

	I just downloaded Macsbug from ftp.apple.com like it said, and
installed it in my System folder. I restarted the mac an hour later, and it 
wouldn't completely boot off the internal HD. I get the ""happy mac"", then it
disappears, only to reappear and repeat the cycle continuously. I never even
get the ""Welcome to Macintosh"" message. Norton utilities fixed about 12 new
problems, but the same thing still happened.

	What do I do?

	Please e-mail to ""orly@aludra.usc.edu""

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  
trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  
and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  
to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  
place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  
that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  
wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  
could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   
It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  
wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  
correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  
my NeXT that way.

Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  
problem, and at pretty high speeds too.

I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  
pretty standard.

Hope this helps,

The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140.
The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.  I don't
know about the newer PowerBooks, but I kind of doubt it.  I got bit by

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can ""hiccup"" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will
bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective
resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend
to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would
work better for images.

I've seen the ScanMan go for as little as $100 used. It is a reasonable buy
at that price. Higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used
flat bed scanners. Here is Seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains
in the classifieds. Used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately.
Grey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350.

In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading 040 models
of apple. They simply change crystals and add a fan.
Hammerhead: Centris 610 was able to work with 25 MHz (cooler prefered)
            and for 1000 DM you get an 68040 (33MHz) which works with the
            appropriate crystal at full speed. (extra cooling required)    
            Centris 650 like Quadra 700 with extra cooling 33MHz works on
            most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a
            Quadra 950 at 40 MHz wow! But for better description you should
            get this issue of C't (a german PC magazine!)

There is one reason: market size.

The market size for color quickdraw for accellerated plusses and

  A 256K DRAM chip is a 256 kilobit chip whereas a 256K SIMM is a 256
kilobyte memory module. The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge
and on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256
KBytes.
 
  You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter.
Apple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or
special memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what
kind of chips you need.

  Try Goldstar. They make them, and they are available immediately in Mac
configurations. I ordered a pair from Computerland (8 meg variety) and
they work like a charm. I've had them for two weeks.

Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the
warranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications, near
Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))
and a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne,
and every piece (the serial cable, the telephone cable, etc.) had AT&T 
part numbers on them, except the QuickLink software package and the 
CompuServe intro kit.

If anyone's interested, Logos number is (800) 837-7777.  I ordered mine
last Wednesday and got my modem on Friday, though it's not to far from
Cleveland to Pittsburgh.. :-)  On the down side they only ship UPS COD.

   I have tested this on a 230 and it does work there.  So it would
seem that the 140 and 170 are out though.  One way to tell is to
go and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1).  There is a setting
there that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac.  If it
is present when you open the control panel, then you can assume that
SetWUTime will work.

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

The si has a single expansion slot, that can be either PDS or Nubus, but not
both together. The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & HD and
requires an adaptor slot to do this. There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards.
Thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you
have. With the exception of the Radius rocket, all NuBus cards I know of work
in the si. PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific, thus not all PDS cards
work in all Macs.

Hi there!

I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display
card for driving a 14"" multisync (NEC 3D)?
The NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and
vertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,
though I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624
noninterlaced.
It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
8bits/pixel, preferably more.

Is there anything on the market that comes even close?

Hi there!

What is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for

I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining, but don't know

    None. You need to buy 2 80ns 256k VRAM SIMMs. They cost about $30
each from your favorite memory distributor.

    The 512k is soldered to the logic board. There are 2 SIMM slots for

Could be better caching on the disk.
Could be faster coil for seeks.
Could be that the disk spins faster so data transfers faster.
Could be that data is packed tighter so it transfers faster.
Could be a faster SCSI command decoder in the drive.

Among other things...

You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines.  There is already 512K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a 
total of 1 MB.

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.
It's small enough that I will attach it.

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to
40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective
difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better.  I do not have an FPU.

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.

If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to
see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called
""Performance Rating"" numbers by themselves are of no interest. 

Cheers.

What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you
listed as #1.  Any ideas about how I can get one?  I bought my IIvx 8/120
from Direct Express in Chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good
service).

BTW, I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac;
however, my drive will NOT accept a CD caddy is the machine is off.  How can
you boot with it then?

The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the
book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed
is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)

The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately,
System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.

Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1,
but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes
channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many
sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
*undocumented* flag and modify it.

Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get
rid of the bugs.

Any better suggestions? (Silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)

I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner
CP3040A.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers.
Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   1
          o o o o   o   2

         L5  CR12   C37

where the ""o"" are pins, and the ""L5 CR12 C37"" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?

Does GX take the place of 32 bit QD or add to it? Right now 32 bit is

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].

But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25"" disks.  I hate using 5.25"" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5""'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.

Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.

Good luck....

   A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the 
msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it 
best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, 
however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available 
on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning 
of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you 
wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).
Good luck,

- Pete

light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.

How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from

I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with
my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.  
When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is
fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen 
gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a 3/4"" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can
manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just
shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't 
been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and
both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried
to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...
So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what
to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm
not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.

P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set-
ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size
of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.

Yes, You bought the WRONG SIMMS.....You need 1X36 or 4X36, which are 72 pin
SIMMS.....These are better anyway becuase the send/receive data in 4byte
(32bit+4bit parity, one for each byte) Chunks. You will undoubtedly see these
SIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future.

If I were running at a new chip at a Trade show, and had little to no real
technical knowledge,  I wouldn't let some stranger with a diskette boot my demo
machine.  If the demo machine is down too long people will not see my nice
demos, and if this purposted LINUX diskette is really something that will wipe
the disk, or is loaded with a VIRUS!, I'm in deep trouble.

No marketer in their right mind would let you do this, unless they had
specifically invited people to do so, and provided machines to do it with.

We can we learn : This technology will be shipping from PC vendors in May 1993,
and will be i486 compatible.

I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase.  One
of the key points was the ability to use my American Express card.  I 
read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank
VISA.  Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank
has a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your
monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.

Remember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info
to them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and
then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register
pak arrived today).  Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.

   Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways
lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My
machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from
when I called the order in. 

   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the 
peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I
was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway 
documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.
The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came
with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)
was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and 
has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a 
lot to do with it. 

   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications. 
I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the other
machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to these
drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a
peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.
It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this
machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the 
peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. 

  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also
by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430
credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!

  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it
was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)

Maybe its a monitor problem.  You mentioned that you swapped cards, but not
monitors.  Perhaps that could be it.

Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so
quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience
with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that
sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn
about the products they sell.  Talk about incompetent!  O.K., so a few percent
of their answers are correct, but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid
they are.   ...  .......  O.K.  ...I'll settle down now....  .... let me
catch my breath.....  ..

Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.

Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested
in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine;
for example most of my education about carpeting, wall paper, lawn mowers,
microwave ovens, etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an
idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do, however, care about my
computer - i.e. I demand features and performance, and I'll be damned if I'll
pay some high-school drop out commission on an over-rated, over-priced system
and in the process be subjected to his distorted B.S.

Thanks to all who responded to my original post.  I got the number for
Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the
BIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/
write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable by
check or money order.  Send to:

	Western Digital Corporation
	Technical Support Group
	P.O. Box 19665
	Irvine, CA  92713-9665

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the
WD1002 series.

The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.

The responses to my request for help follow my .sig.  Warning: It's long.

     Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older
stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  

    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on
the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read 
either :     62-000042-015 or
             62-000094-0x2

     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.

>	W6	1-2 3
>	W7	1 2 3

    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.

>The drive jumpers are as follows: (""8"" represents jumper)

    Looks right.
  
[art deleted]

>Here are my questions:
>
>1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?

      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have
the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:

              5 + +    open
              6 + +    open             
              7 + +    open        
              8 + +    open
              4 + +    closed
              3 + +    closed
              2 + +    open
              1 + +    open

    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.
Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).   

      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have
to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.

>2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?

      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not
right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   
     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....

>3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?

     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:
       
        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)
   
    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.

>Keith Rice

      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's
just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).

If you are using a TWISTED 34-way cable then move the jumper 
on your drive to the neighbouring pins   :8::::::.  Make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the
coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.

This may also help.

          ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) 
          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or 
          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the 
          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then 
          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the 
          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 
          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION 
          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY 
          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the 
          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must 
          be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the 
          interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR SCSI HARD DISK DRIVES
     
          
          7000-ASC - A SCSI host adapter that serves as an interface 
          between the AT bus and the SCSI bus.  All necessary drivers and 
          receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to 
          the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus 
          through two edge connectors.  The 7000-ASC utilizes jumper  
          configurable options that enable the address space, DMA channels 
          and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end user's 
          application.  The board also features word data transfer at 4 
          megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk 
          controller and a ROM BIOS.  Please note that the 7000-ASC 
          operates using standard DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3 only.
          
          7000-FASST2 - This SCSI host adapter card provides the same 
          features as the 7000-ASC plus additional support capabilities 
          using software developed by Columbia Data Products.  The 7000-
          FASST2 will support MS-DOS 3.2-3.3, Compaq DOS 3.31, PC-DOS 4.0, 
          PC-MOS/386 version 2.1, XENIX, Microsoft Windows, Novell and 
          Sytos tape backup.
          
          WDATXT-FASST KIT - An ""unintelligent"" SCSI host adapter that is 
          compatible with the IBM XT, AT and compatible systems.  It uses 
          a 50 pin external SCSI bus ""D"" connector with a standard 50 pin 
          internal SCSI cable.  The WDATXT-FASST can be used as  both a 
          target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
          SCSI designers.  It also provides a low cost alternative for end-
          users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a 
          hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. The kit includes an 8-bit 
          SCSI HBA board, manual, FASST software diskettes and an internal 
          SCSI cable.

I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4
shares IRQ3 with COM2, except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not
clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the
standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how.

as someone else already mentioned, don't ""carry thru"" the other 23 pins.

plan A, minimal null modem:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
if you're transfering files betwen 2 PCs, this ought to work (unless
you have a persnickity comm program).

plan B, null modem with modem control:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)
	DTR(20) -  DCD(8)
some comm software will wait for DCD before transferring anything.
such software will raise DTR to enable the modem to accept a call.
with this cable, each side's DTR will drive the other's DCD.

plan C, null modem with hardware flow control:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)
	CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)
for high-speed transfers, you want the flow control.

plan D, deluxe null modem (combine B and C):
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)
	CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)
	DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)
	DTR(20) -  DCD(8)
this one is ideal.  it leaves out DSR and RI (rarely used anymore).
if you're really paranoid, or you just have an 8th wire to spend,
you might add:
	FG(1)   -  FG(1)

the pin numbers above are (obviously) for 25-pin connectors.
i don't have a 9-pin pinout handy.

  Hi All,

  I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. one
can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c.
  Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some ""non-trivial"" data
to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.) from
inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the
specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they
may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above,

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new

how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone

pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!

What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio
player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system
can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!

Please help if you can with the following strange problem:

COuld the sound card use IRQ2 without horsing up the works?

Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer
configuration is :

486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz)
16MB Ram
ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk, SCSI
UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller

When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark, I get a Harddisk data transfer
about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought
that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host 
adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system, do I need that ?
A guy I know, gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec, and he has an ST3283A and
a ISA 486DX-50, how can a ISA with the same system be faster ?

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?


                                        Thanks.

Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are 
considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice 
size external cache!  The performance is far greater.

The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither 
systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is 
still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).

don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them 
between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless 
they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one 
bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that 
the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent 
configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit 
nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte 
).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent 
because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM 
interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry 
if too techie for ya].

That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit 
wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  
Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit 
CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data 
from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when 
it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard 
links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in 
this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means 
that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you 
have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide 
data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks 
are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data 
with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by 
one SIMM at a time.

Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your 
question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'

Is it possible to plug an ordinary ISA card into a VESA localbus slot?
I am running out of slots and I have one spare localbus slot.

Hello,


Can anyone out there tell me if it is possible to put ordinary standard
SIMM RAM chips (70 ns) in a COMPAQ PROLINEA 4/50 or do COMPAQ require 
special COMPAQ RAM chips. 

Please (also) email me.


Thanks in advance.

Anonymous,

I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.
I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's
external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing,
but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that
faster... 
I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times 
as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!

No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last
fall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are
drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like
486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K
of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real
estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its
486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become
available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other
companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out
with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).

Hi,
I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would
like to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-level
format, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up the
parameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowing
what this does.
The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB.
I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and not
the nominal 80MB.
Could I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actual
parameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them?
And how does FDISK work together with user type 47?
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM
Thank you,

While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the
sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,
it is only ""relatively"" recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,
mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.
If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixes/releases.

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the ""right"" person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting
addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the
Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond.

If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive, then the noise
is probably coming from there and not from the fan.  The Western drives
are notoriously noisy.  On the other hand, if you don't have a Western
drive, then maybe it is the fan.  There's not alot to do about it except
insulate around the cpu somehow.

Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working
on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with
Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU
with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and 
Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong
with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to
access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C
code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that
will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.

I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code
that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I
am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack
of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.
I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and
then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, 
the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do
nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses
the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt
int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )
the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )
and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as
to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

- 101 Keyboard
- 200 Watt power supply
- Windows 3.1, Mouse, DOS 6.0
- *3* years limited warranty
- 1 year on-site service

I'm probably going to add the $125 for a 15"" flat-screen digital monitor, and
will also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM ($159 extra).

Has anyone bought from EPS Technologies, particularly a system like the one
I'm considering.  I'm especially interested in their warrantee and service.
Can anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages, with support,
and comparable prices (I see FastMicro just bit it...).

I purchased a Super Voyager VLB 33Mhz board from Washburn & Company a month ago.
I don't have the mailing address-- Clyde Washburn advertises regularly in PC Week.  He can also be reached via CompuServe.    The phone number is    
1-800-836-8027.

I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about
concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  
critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.

These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points, but, I will
provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board
video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and
you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of
them with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and
either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.

Do not buy a 486SX sytem.

My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When
you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they
get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large
steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX
models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.

Howdy,

Sorry if this has been covered before:

One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his
NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said ""No problem"" and went to work.
Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit 
Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted 
with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition 
was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a
32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried 
to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am 
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I 
kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS 
installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for 
""Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC"")...

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Upgrade 386SX-25 to 386DX-40 ?
Organization: Edinburgh University
Lines: 41

I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am
running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my
flatmates' games.

My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9
Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.

Basically I have two choices

1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or
2) Get some sort of 486.

Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high.
The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at
this price for a SX-25.

I have a couple of questions.

1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a
386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point
operations.

2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?

Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for
AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?

	Any experiences will be most helpful ...

		Kenny.

PS. Example prices:

	386DX-40+copro M/board	~$270
	486DX33	M/board		~$580

Hi,
I've got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel
interface) and two floppy drives (5 1/4, 3 1/2) and a
Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it.
I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from
it. I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter)
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch,
the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is
not accessed at all.
I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card
or floppy disk drive settings (jumper configuration?)
Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it.
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM

A silly question: I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them
on several floppy diskettes of the same size and format, but my computer is
only equipped with one 3.5"" HD drive and one 5.25"" HD drive; can't I do the
copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9% full)
using standard MSDOS 5.0 commands? I know
diskcopy a: a:
works but for small selections of files,
xcopy a:*.txt a:
does not!
Maybe I'll have to write my own file copy command in C, but the idea does not

    ^^^
How long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new
parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty
but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? 

When it comes to local dealers:

- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their ""techs"" are
re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.

- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.

- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done
period, unless you are on a paid service contract.

Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a
ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what
I'm talking about. 

I also know the ""local service"" scam that retail computer dealers like
to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers
having been singing for years -- ""Buy from me and you'll get good
service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition
and you'll be sorry if you need service."" 

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, 
on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you
good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good 
service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point, 
but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.

H E L P !

I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Some background about my PC:

- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM
- config.sys file:

	device=c:\dos\himem.sys
	dos=high,umb
	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
	files=30
	buffers=30
	stack=9,256

- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.

The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.
Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows.

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:

- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address

Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address
0001:XXXX means? 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.

Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try
anything.

A friend who owns a company that builds clones shared with me the fact that
the PCI chipset is NOT expensive -- how about $12?  Many money-hungry-clone
makers, no doubt, will attempt to price the boards high only because it's
new technology.

Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a 486DX50 and
a 25MHz local bus.

I'm waiting for the mezzianine (sp?) VL bus that will be decoupled from
the main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers.

This will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard I/O
cards. Until the next buss spec...

Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to
(usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No
motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call
failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use
""slower"" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that
slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.

Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster RAM.  

Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus 
slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.

Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?

If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  
As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more 
than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in 
the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is 
at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?  

Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the 
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.

If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either
the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head
assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may
need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor
is out. 

If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for
repair.

Hi,

I am going through a box of old IBM card and came across one called a 

Rapid Technology SQUEEZE card.  It is dated 1990 and has a 54mhz crystal on
it and a big chip that has 'C-Cube' on it.

No connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type 50-pin connector on the board.

It is a 16-bit board.

Any ideas what it is?

I saw in this months PC or PC World an ad for computers using IBM's 486SLC.
So I don't think IBM is restricted in selling their chips, at least not
anymore. A clock-tripled 486, even without coprocessor would be great,
especially with 16k on-board cache. Make it 386 pin-compatible, and you
have the chip upgrade that dreams are made of :-)

First of all, thanks to those of you who responded, both here and via e-mail.
The tips didn't pan out, but it was good hearing from you.

Now, following up to my earlier post:
[...]
: Disk controller:  Acculogic sIDE-3 2 hard/2 floppy IDE controller
:   Jumpers:  All defaulted (shown as *):  
:     Normal IRQ*/delayed IRQ     Primary*/secondary floppy address
:     Single*/dual speed floppy   Primary*/secondary IDE address
:     Precomp = 125ns*/187 ns     IOCHRDY not driven*/IDE drive controls IOCHRDY
[...]
: Other cards:  (didn't check brand) 2 Serial/1 Parallel adapter
: 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter
: 	      Roland MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface 
: 		Configured with default IRQ 2, mem address 0330

I opened up the box and removed all the ""other cards"" above.  No help there.
Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed
IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_
driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put 
everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.

I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!,
the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds 
before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back
to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.

O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any 
words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM.

UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window (1024x768x256):        gave up after 4 min!
UW/WIN in Windows 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min
UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window using pg       30 sec, could have been a

                                                hitting the space bar)

I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card, by the way.

So PC-Xview for DOS looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling
in OS/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty
good).

I tried it under PC-Xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,
and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times.
The modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the
bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing.

Hello,

	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  
8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  
both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  
of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  
can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  
$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid...

So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  
do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  
appreciated.

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mb/s.

[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!

You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE
interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info
sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the
info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:
Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some 
 specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller 
 specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a
 SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2
 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be 
 very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst 
 {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and
 reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between
 SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.

IBM
HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:
[...]
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode
it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its
cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}

SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while
IDE itself limits the through put.

The last time I was in microprocessor lab was in 1980, using Z-80.
So I don't know a lot of buzz terms in PC hardware.

Now I need to purchase a 486, help me to ask the right questions.

Motherboard:
    I need 486-33 with 8 MB ram, with additonal slot for 8 more MB.
    I would like to get two VESA Local Bus. One for video, not sure
    what am I going to do with the other. 
    It must be able to run Unix.
    
    What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a
    quality stuff? What are other important features ?


Monitor:
    I want a 14"" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand
    to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider?
    Acer? Touch?

    What else should I ask?

Video Card: 
    I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western
    Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of 
    V-RAM?

    One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal?
    

Hard Drive:
    Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is
    more liable? which one has better performace?

Case/power supply:
    Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?
    What is the adequate power supply?
    Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?
    What features should I ask for?
    
Did I miss anything?

I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

How about 250MB/s for 64-bit VLB or 350MB/s for QuickRing {Apple's
implimentation of VLB (Byte 10/92:132)} QuickRing is interesting in that
it allows interleaving with other card so that the 350MB/s can be divided 
among many cards at the same time {NuBus 90 and MCA are about the only card 
interfaces able to DO anything with that kind of speed and even NuBus 90
ditzes around at ~30MB/s with a burst mode: 80MB/s.
""MCA {Also called Micro Channel}
 IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; ""allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"" 
 (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, >>as fast as the two components 
 involved can handle it.<< Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA 
 and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).

IDA can't handle VLB speed never mind QuickRings's speed so it is out.
EISA pokes along at NuBus Mac II speeds {~15MB/s burst mode: 33MB/s}
 so VLB and QuickRing are slowed down by it.
PCI is a competing interface that is still in development.

That's nonsense!!  You can use ISA cards in an EISA-system without problem

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages.
when booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work.

(ok I know this is not very user friendly, maybe you are better off
buying a 486-66 with 300 watt power supply or something like that)

there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called
'theref22.zip' which has lots of info on various PC things,
amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller
commands, I think hard drive controller commands are not there.

it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector

8K).

I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)
	and have on-site service install it for me.
BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours
with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$
to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and
I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole 
thing is going back.  
  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me
that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything
up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.

I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support
again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.
Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is
booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.
Oh well, I feel better now...

Hello

I have recently suffered from various problems concerning
an Adaptec 1542A controller.

Problem 1:
Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers
on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I
have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like
to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they 
are located.

Problem 2:
My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)
I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been
formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating
system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting
the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible
memory drivers.
Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

	Thanks in advance

        Jouni

Hello folks!

I have an Archive XL5580 (internal QIC-80) tape drive, which is pretty
comparable to the Colorado Jumbo 250.  Since I have two floppy drives in
my system, I'm using a small card (not accelerated) made by Archive to 
attach my tape drive as a third floppy device.

The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine,
both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless
I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).  Since
the DOS software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it?  Has anyone
seen similar problems?  Any solutions?  Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers.
I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard.
What are good options for this (preferably under $200). It MUST also work
under OS/2 and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W).

Please advise .....

I'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution:
I need an ISA/VLB scsi controller (e.g Ultrastor 34F)
plus a tape drive (500Mb or less like Archive) plus a Windows
program that will work on these.

My intended system will have 32Mb RAM so
plain ISA controllers will no longer do.
But I also hear that the SCSI world
is not very organized.

So does anybody have a tape backup setup

We have a Gateway 486DX50 with a SMC Elite16 Series Ethercard Plus.

When we use NCSA FTP to send from the Gateway with hash turned on, we see
4 hash marks immediately.  Then the computer  r e a l l y  drags.  If we turn 
off the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match
the speed when we receive to the Gateway.

It doesn't matter if we send from the Gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and 
then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled.

Does anyone know any more about this?  Is there a fix?

The Gateway was purchased in June, 1992.

Please respond directly.  You wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this 
system.

I also use IRQ 5.  But there is one disadvantage.  Some games assume that
the board is using IRQ 7 and have no way to adjust this setting.  I had

XGA or XGA-2?  For the original XGA you just need something that can do
1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them ""8514 compatible"" and they
should get the idea).  For the XGA-2, get what you like.  I prefer multi-
syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
my home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them
in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like
1360x1024x16.

Some motherboards support VL bus and 50-DX CPU.  There is an option
(BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to
CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives
the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s)
are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to
enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.

This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-
tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at
least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.

Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)
	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)
	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)
	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)
	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]

	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

Hi,

I just inherited an NCR 1204 external floppy.  This thing has every port known to man on the back.
The question is: Does anyone know how to connect this thing to a PC. What hardware is needed?
Software?

TIA,
Alex

P.S. please respond directly.  I am not on this alias.

Nntp-Posting-Host: jamie.dev.cdx.mot.com
Organization: Motorola Codex, Canton, Massachusetts
Lines: 14

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do
1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is
a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I
think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62
- not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to
something else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose. Anyway:

 - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA
   display with a 1-meg trident 8900C card?

 - if not, can I do so with some sort of different VGA card?

Subject: Request info on a mystery PC card
Organization: IDX Corporation, S. Burlington, VT
Lines: 11

While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts, I found a half-size
board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and
has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector
and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC
and ran Advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each
time, but the system did not recognise a comm port.

Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?
I could use another comm port if it's free.

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?

Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone
know how they perform?

Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card
(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented
data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

Suddenly, the date no longer rolls over.  The time is (reasonably) accurate

Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lines: 36

Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory
from us"" or something like that.)

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""

	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.

	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less
busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.

	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out
there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I
coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.

Thanks.

On my 486DX-50 (really 50, not DX2), my AT bus is set to CLK/3.

At 16.67 MHz, I have no problems.  Soundblaster Pro, Zoom 14.4 FXM, RLL

If I set it to 2 (25 MHz), I simply don't get past the POST routines.

Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is
reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt.

On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,
a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight
with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem
was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon
as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it

These symptoms disappear when I switch to non-turbo mode (8 MHz).
I suspect some timing dependent Rom Bios routines. (There's a newer version

By the way, my new mother board has AMI Bios, 128k Cache, 8 MHz bus, and

This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in
the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I
found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the
same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's
the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron
(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB
motherboard.

I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that
Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never
heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because
my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines
and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better
warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have
recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should
trust the company.

I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the
clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about
either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I
go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.

Thanks very much in advance for any information.

The problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like SMARTDRV ) and

	This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do

	This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the

	The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive

I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post, but DRAM *does not* have to
be refreshed on *each access cycle*.  So cycle time does *not* have to be
twice the access time *because of refresh phase*.

The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw
address strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.

DRAM access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following (some
signals are intentionally omitted);

ADDR --<RA><CA>-------<RA><CA>--------- RA=Raw Address, CA=Column Address
RAS  ~~~~\________/~~~~~\________/~~~~~		~=High, _=Low, -=Floating
CAS  ~~~~~~~\_______/~~~~~~\_______/~~~		<..>=driven either H or L
DATA ---------<VALID>--------<VALID>---
         |-------+------|
         |-+--|  |
           |     +----------- cycle time
           +---- access time (or RAS access time)

Yes, the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but *not*
because of the refresh phase.  The refresh can be done either as a
trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.

and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.
This monitor can be had for around $1070.

Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a

Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MB/s and Hard drives START
at 160MB I have NO idea.
For the Mac I have the following {These are ALL external}
 20MB $299 {$15/MB}
 52MB $379 {$7.3/MB}
 80MB $449 {$5.63/MB}
120MB $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/MB
210MB $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/MB}
320MB $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/MB}
510MB $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/MB}
etc

So scsi-1/SCSI-2 for the Mac goes down in price/MB as hard drive size goes
up {and I assume the same for the PC world.}

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE
inteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used
for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle 
it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.
In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.
Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards 
{this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.
IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any
and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface
{Make of that what you will}
SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.
This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.
Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played
and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end
computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI
off into the statosphere price wise}
SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the
standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it
choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined
interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces
{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}

I have the same question as Guido. It is possible to use the ESDI drive as a master and the IDE drive as the slave ? 
At the moment , I have been using the ESDI drive and recently I bought a IDE drive to use as the 2nd drive . 
The person in the computer shop told me that it is not possible to run 2 disk controller cards together on the same motherboard ( ESDI AND IDE ) but I think there might be some way of making them work. Can anybody enlighten me on this?
And it is possible to  run a ESDI HDD using a IDE controller? or vice versa?
Can anybody please help me out on this?
Your help will be very much appreciated.

Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5"" drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?
I'm in desperate need of help!!!

Thank you for your time.

I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re:
performance. Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actual
performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd:

SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s.
SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s.
IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.
ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

Hi,

    I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B,
and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.

    I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI
drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups
from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins
actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE
drive.

    I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to 
enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any
mention of it in the manuals.

 My system config is:
   i486DX/33 4Mb 
   Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI
   IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE
   Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE

  Any help would be appreciated

It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my
hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than
a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick.

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. 
I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works
quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear
and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features.

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here
compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.

Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,
down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into
a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know
much beyond that.

***** Windows 3.1 enhanced mode:

     The Windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec 1542.  However, just in case
something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed
that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when
you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".


* MSDOS configuration:

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,
you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive
(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs
much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section
called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system
up.


* Windows configuration:

     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the
""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you
might want to try adding some more lines:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off
	SystemROMBreakPoint=false
	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF

(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The
""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).


* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:

     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that
your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's
probably because:

     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your
	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a
	winning solution.

     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen ....

If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the
Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808
(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use
Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really
slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other
solutions.

     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you
do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.
What you can do is one of the following:

     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in
	Smartdrive.

     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for
	""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported
	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like
	the 1542) to work with Windows.

     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following
solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I
am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused
by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following
does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:

1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI
   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two
   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your
   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies
   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's
   still there).

2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version
   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers
   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS
	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high
   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would
   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support
   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.

   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would
   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE
   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason
   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.

   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without
   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider
   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.

3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer
   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only
   three ways to get a copy:

      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other
	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is
	around $75.

      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around $30.

      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0
	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is
	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.

Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing
this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers
(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems
show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case
it isn't a hardware problem.


***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a
floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 250:

1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive
   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.

2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.
   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so
   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   1542.)


* Tape backups/restores take a long time:

     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may
have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best
results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup
or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the
Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,
start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
than necessary.

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,
rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is
""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the
tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too
much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,
because data is not fed to it quickly enough.

     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.
The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can
be done in one of two ways:

* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use
  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:

	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4

  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".

* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The
  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to
  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:

	setscsi -n:4

  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running
  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults.

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use
  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I
  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.

Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it
above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4
microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little.

     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores
should run faster.

     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other
options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what
you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
starving memory refresh.

     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),
this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried
running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I
was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a
conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,
although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?


* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:

     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my
system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm
mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my
1542.

     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the
tape head:

1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,
   resulting in an aborted tape backup.

2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.

3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.
   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a
   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,
   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.

4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other
   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.

5. Too many tape read errors.

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I
upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy
controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)
reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive.

     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;
however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller.


***** Sound cards:

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and
this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the
Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the
tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error
(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is
that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a
parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware.

     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,
recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).

     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the
Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may
not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the
speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this.


***** Miscellaneous info:

     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much
of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not
verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm
not sure.  Use it at your own risk.

* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""
  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.
  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install
  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a
  version earlier than 6.00).

  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.

* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is
  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.

* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand
  information):

     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for
	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact
	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need.

     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM
	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know
	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around
	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS
	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,
	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.

     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410
	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in
	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin
	boards.

* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are
  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the
  following is secondhand information):

     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers
	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.

     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but
	requires, ASPI4DOS.

* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:

     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.
     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.
     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and
	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:

     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI
	drivers).

* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you
  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used
  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know
  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,
  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:

	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>
	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx
	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10
	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might
  have it, if any forum does.

* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are
  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.
  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of
  BSD Unix).

* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS
  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked
  like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I
  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first
  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version
  doesn't.

     No, you need not bypass the config.sys, in Dos 6.0, there is a function 
of multi-config, have you tried BOOT.SYS ? the multi-config is the kind that 
you can choose you config.sys at the startup. And I find that is very good. 
It has no conflict to QEMM. (I have problem when using BOOT.SYS)
    The key you say is F8, which is trace the config.sys step by step.

of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal
behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.

Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/

Oh yeah! I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday (to replace my old 8515), and
I tried it with 1360x1024. This mode is just great! I can get four perfectly readable
command windows on the screen! And if I need more colors, I can go back to 1024x768
or even 800x600.
One thing I am wondering though: Why isn't there a MONxxxx.DGS file which contains
ALL the resolutions up to 1360x1024? Now I have to change the XGASETUP.PRO every
time I want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of OS/2.

Re: Problems with S3-initialization

As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization
of the S3 card.

InitDisplay;
	(*BIOS-Call
		with AX-Reg = 4F02H
		with BX-Reg = 105H for 1024 x 768 x 256 resolution
		Interrupt 10H *)
Unlock Register Lock 1 (CR38)
	(* For access to S3 Register Set *)
Unlock Register Lock 2 (CR39)
	(* For access to Syst. Control and Syst. Extension Register *)
Unlock Graphic Command Group (CR40)
	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Syst. Configuration Register *)
Unlock Advanced Display Functions
	(* Set Bit 0 to 1 in Function Control Register *)

After these operations the FIFO-stack of the S3 should be empty.
When we watch the status (Graph. Proc. Status), we always get
the value 0FH instead of 0H.
Full would mean 0FFH (8 places occupied), empty would mean 0H
(0 places occupied).

It is possible to read this register in two different ways. 
Both times we get different results.



Our machine is a 486 DX/2 with EISA bus and a S3 86C805 local bus. 

--> any ideas?

I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is
DX2/66 VLB. I has the save transfer rate of 0.647 MB/s regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between
5.5MHz and 8.33MHz. Not _any_ difference. The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory.

My advice: Buy 4Megs of RAM, save $70 and enjoy performance.

Hello world,
 
I'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching
purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings
of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for
example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 AND 1 = 1) so that the
students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally
logical, for example. Every instruction should show some 'working',
and not just alter register/memory/port contents.
 
Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,
in Pascal or Modula-2, that would show me where I'm going wrong
in writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller-
as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill
for simple teaching purposes, I feel, and there's no source code to help
you roll your own.]

I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The
two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be
able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be
able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I
think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT.

Organization: University of Massachusetts, Amherst

Reply-To: David.Todd@Psych.UMass.EDU
NNTP-Posting-Host: titan.ucs.umass.edu

I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:

486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram
on a Novell 3.11 network
Monitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations:

I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word
processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.

With a 15"" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256
colors seems plenty, but I'd like like the image to be sharp, fast,
and rock solid.

Other considerations:

I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some
companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party
development of drivers.

I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking.

I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later).

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.

If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it via email or post.

Thanks.

I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.
The summary:

CTX 14"": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.

CTX 15"" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.
  Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning
  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.

I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay
shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. 

It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron
(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.

Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to
send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it,
but has good potential.

First off, with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce, IDE may no longer be sufficient for me (510 Mb limit).
Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good
cohesive set of SCSI drivers.

Hi,
VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz
and 2 cards by 40MHz

there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots.
(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)

50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.

Better OSs (OS/2 & iX) are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM,
if you use EISA-Bus.
Has someone experience with VLB ??
I think of SCSI-VLB-Busmaster. The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller, which is unable to reach more than 16MB.

on april 15, I have no confirmation that production did start on this day
just the word of the tech on the other line.

now the flame......
you would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs. 
very poor tech support (the first 2 times I called I must have spoke with the

Well, not to be picky, but the V in VLB stands for VESA.
While the V in VESA stands for video, saying the V in VLB stands

I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask
the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper
ones that I want to know more.
The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening
to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but
that's not really relevant at the moment.

I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated.
They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2.
The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give
your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not
all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as
a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.

I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually
about times 1.8.

Mitsumi CRMC     $240
Philips LMS-I    $300
Philips 205      $350
Toshiba ?        $370
Nec CDR-74       $650

Who bought that Trantor that is in the faq? It's extremely cheap and SCSI,
so what's the trick or where can I order it (Holland using MasterCard).

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4"").

Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has
a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right
side doesn't help matters.

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? 
Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here 
also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 
MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of 
spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA 
local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.

Hi to all you PC gurus!

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently
asked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems
with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find
corrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities
that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem
is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware
item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly
aligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on this
matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything
(and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assurance
of what the problem cause is. 

Also, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and
defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have
those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)? 


Much thanks in advance for any help.

Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT:

I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask.

The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with
SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI.

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s
and that is ALL you have right about SCSI
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too.
SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 
By your OWN data the ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI"" is correct
With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed
""20% faster than IDE"" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been
posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on 
sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as 
mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}

Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip
an Apple salesperson said ""it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip"" {Not at a 6MB/s,
10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see
SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven
in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH
FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.

Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.
One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is 
(Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).

If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation
processed PS.

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.

We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several.

I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future

The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system,
and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).

The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the
system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on
the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM
hard disks can't be found.

The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &
Seagate MFM controller) are in the system. 

Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future
Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg
is connected.

I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O
port. Have I missed anything?

I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.

reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected
the A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and
the number of ""stupid"" install programs that can't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And
as for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements.

If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I haven't tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully.

We are trying to install a donated hard disk (Miniscribe

I began using PCs after 286s were invented, so I have
a couple of basic questions:

1.  Did XT-class computers even *have* SETUP programs?

2.  If they did (or, do), how do I access it?

If anybody has any good advice on how to proceed or

I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with
everything about Zeos.  That computer went off to grad school with my son and
I replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper,
128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor.  I got a
17"" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase.  This is a *great* system, fast,
quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  Tech support seems 
busier now than 2 years ago.  I called with a configuration question, and
they called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  I think there's a
slight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they 
have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,
customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to
talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.

Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the

The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube,
has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in 
a flatter screen than other 17"" monitors using the standard trinitron 
(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything. OS/2 does,
so with that you can't share the IRQ.

There is a premium of approx $200 for the controller. What is nice is 
being able to run hard disks, tape drives, cd-roms and scanners of
one dma channel and interupt!

SCSI makes sense is you are going to load up a machine, if you just want
a standard box for Windows then IDE makes sense.

I have one loaded box that uses SCSI and run Unix and one standard box
that runs DOS/Windows that uses IDE.


[ By standard I mean - 486, 4-8MB RAM, 200MH disk, S3 video ]

Subject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)
Organization: Adobe Systems Incorporated
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]
Lines: 79


I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor
is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the
monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.

In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those
are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3
cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.

The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone
with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable
to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they
were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz
386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers
were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with
8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,
filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --
1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,
but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my
work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

Hi Netters!

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about
my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:

1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).
    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / 
    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5"" and 5.25"" floppies.

2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).

From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these 
options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking 
(I don't know very much about these beasts):

1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?
    What do the floppies themselves cost?


2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any
    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?
 

3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)


4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or 
    recommendations for manufacturers?  

I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will
summarize all responses for the net.

I am using a 8507 IBM monitor (19"" greysale) with a Trident (1MB) card.

The screen looks great (Windows) at 640x480 but total shit at 1024x768.
There are lots of lines and the image is sorta blurry.

Is there anything I can do.  Do you think it is the monitor?  I know
that it is Interlaced at that res but still.

Still no good.  WatchIT TV will not work on a with local bus video.
It will not work in any high reolution modes either.  The people who
make the card assure me that they will have a card available in June 
that supports both local-bus and hi-res.  BTW does anyone know the

    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?
    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time
    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.

I've tried fiddling the jumpers to set the master and slave drives

Has anyone else got this combination to work.  The place I got the
new one muttered something like ""Hmmm  Fujitsu, nice drives, not

but he thought it was more a problem with the Fujitsu.

This chip would take 25ns to return valid data after being issued an address.

Refresh time (none for SRAM, as you pointed out) is a different parameter,
and is not generally referred to except by motherboard designers.

About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a
CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I
had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with
CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a
major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this
until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now
find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled
correctly by the ASW-410 driver.

So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their
FAX number?

Any assistance appreciated.

BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with
     the rest with the 641.

Hi!

I recently switched my 3.5"" drive to A:. The problem is, while I can read and
write to both the new A: and B: correctly, I can't boot from a floppy in A:.
I've checked the CMOS settings; it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot

Once, I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A:. I got a
message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. It didn't work.
When I do have a systems disk in the A: drive, this is what happens:
1) Power-on and Memory Test;
2) A: light comes on
3) B: light comes on, followed by a short beep;
4) HD light comes on for an instant;
5) B: light comes on again, then nothing happens

The light goes off, there is no disk activity of any kind, and the screen 
blanks. I can't even use ctrl-alt-del.

Any suggestions.

Subject: HELP! Installing second IDE drive
Organization: SURAnet, College Park, MD, USA, NA, Earth, Milky Way
Lines: 44
NNTP-Posting-Host: azathoth.sura.net

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,
I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been
trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since
my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]
He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number
but I can find out.)

Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get
one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both
at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -
never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS
correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the
master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't
know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers
properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).

The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've
tried several combinations:

controller - master - slave
controller - slave - master
master - controller - slave

None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.

Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for ""C: drive"" and ""D:
drive"" setup info rather than ""drive 1"" and ""drive 2"" like most others
I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?

So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some
info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so
it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!

Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help!

Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of

Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the

If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again, the display works as normal like before.

Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a

years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.

I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.

What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap....

Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.

the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.  
IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.
SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.

neither one is better in all cases.

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa
busmastering cards.

I have a Sony 1604S 17"" monitor and I don't see any lines across
the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode.
But because of the hor. lines and poping that I do see and hear
when I am usinf 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 modes and switch back
to anything of less. I would not buy another Sony at what ever price.
Oh ya this is I guess a 15"" viewing area. It don't impress me one bit!   Sam

I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.
My 2 cents worth:

The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. 
A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach.

Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think
the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.

LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which
way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard
is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't
light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.

If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.

Hope this helps.

I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any
real reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is
the Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip,
but I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with 
claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true
if it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it
lags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one 
of them.

Any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something
much more elementary.

Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and
an initial directory.

If you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain
a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

If you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can
make sense.

I don't think FD is a problem.  Since FD is much sloooooooowwwwwwer

The newer the drive, the less problem you will have. The old ten and fifteen

I suggest that you go direct to the original (and preferred...best quality)
source for all of this, just as you would (at least, should) for the chips
themselves:  National Semiconductor.  you can reach them at 1-800-272-9959.
they no longer package the data sheets in a book, as they did when I got
mine, but you can get them as individual sets of data sheets.  you want, as
a minimum, the following:

   *) 2 sets of data sheets:
      *) NS16450/INS8250A/NS16C450/INS82C50A
      *) NS16550AF

   *) 2 application notes (yes, GET THESE!):
      *) AN-491 The NS16550A: UART Design and Application Considerations
      *) AN-493 A Comparison of the INS8250, NS16450 and NS16550AF Series
         of UARTs

both of the application notes I listed have proven to be AT LEAST as
valuable as the data sheets themselves (more, actually).  AN-491, in
particular, is an exceptionally well-written application note that goes
into detail about how and why the 16550 does what it does, and how best
to take advantage of it.

btw, they send these out free, as long as you don't abuse it.

Who said ISA was necessary?  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth

You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism

interfaced to ISA, EISA or VLB matters not.

On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If

servers?

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives
at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or
Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.

: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for
expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:

A (partial?) list:
	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently.
	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)
	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For
	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor
	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will
	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the
	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.
	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:
	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very
	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.

One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've
added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card.  

Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

If anyone out there can help, I would greatly appreciate it.

This christmas, I built a computer out of used parts for my Father-in-law.
The disk drive that I installed was a Seagate 251-1 MFM.  Anyway, he now he
would like to put another HD into this system.  I DON'T want to buy another
MFM, the only reason why I used an MFM in the first place is that it was
FREE.  Would I need a special IDE HD controller?  Also, if I do need a 
special IDE controller, where can I purchase one, & how much are they?

For what it's worth (I haven't confirmed it), a Diamond tech-rep told

If this is true, it appears that you canNOT use more than one S3 card

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on
PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.
(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)
Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when
compared to IDE?

I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.

IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's
how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be
an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different
platforms.

Is there any argument that 
IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the
drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able
to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because
of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?

If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main
memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE
can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored
in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives 
at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the
same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?

>I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I
>haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245
million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?

So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,
considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or
tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives
at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.

But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you
get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI
choice really give them more performance than IDE?

>But, you bought your PC for
>expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.

True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option
is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.

No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the
best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer
eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single
hard drive system?

With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that
PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, 
is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/
partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?

So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this

After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,
I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor
have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
to/from the same drive.

That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that
there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.

But what about ""mysterious"" (and expensive) drivers to figure out?  At least
IDE doesn't require drivers that consume precious conventional (DOS) memory.

Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.
	Many thanks,
			Cat.

	I have one and it is my favorite CD-ROM drive so far.  I also have

I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. Their Assy
numbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. They
are 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there
are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com
cards. I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic
program for 3C505 succesfully (""..passes with flying colours"") :)

Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..?

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ).
The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can
operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.

A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate
even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape
units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do
something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group.

Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,
thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to
completely get rid of IDE.

We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM4311 5"" floppy drive as the second
drive on a Panasonic 286 machine.  It seems to sort of talk to it (gets it
spinning and stepping) but gives a ""Disk not ready"" error.

There are two jumpers (which seem to work best open), a 3 position DIP
switch, and a 8 position DIP switch.  We don't know how to set the DIP
switches and think that may be the problem.

Any information, or advice (other than ""junk the stupid thing"" :) would be

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI.

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   
nothing to do with SCSI.

And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.

Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things
with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.

        I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and
could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them.
 
        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB
tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi
CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14"" CTX 1468NI,
128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is
$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a
review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of
the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be
appreciated.
 
        In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's
Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14"" MI
monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig

        Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my

Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the ""figure includes a

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:
SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s
 asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.

SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit
 hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1
 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
 {Range 0-5MB/s}
>ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by
people.  Its PROPER meaning is ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of
SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:
(My comments in {})

PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,
{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...""
{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers 
are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed
degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
and monitor.  The floppies are 360k, and the monitor is CGA, but you will need
an adaptor cable to use it.  The junior does not use standard cards.  Unless 
you're really strapped for cash, you should just junk the thing and buy new 
stuff.

What group is this?  This is not a MAC group.

>Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:

Why the spec list again?  We are talking SCSI on a PC, not on a MAC or
a UNIX box.  And we are talking ISA bus, or possibly EISA or VLB.

This isin't comp.periphs.SCSI.
Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC
with an ISA (or EISA or VLB) bus.

Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate.  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the 40 megs/sec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast, but the PC isin't one of
them.

The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1
beta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer.
If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) 

So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and
REM out the Adaptec drivers.

Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM
nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the
right order.. it will work.

Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2
will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you
are off to more REM statements and more fun. 

The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be
configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be
able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

Hope this helps..

- Dan

It's an interesting idea, but the worst-case data patterns developed to

SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s
 synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is
 mainly in software not hardware.

SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with 
10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}

{I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          
 asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}
 synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.

Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true
a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software.
And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY 
CANNOT WE?

With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.}
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: 
(My comments in {})
""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with
a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with 
a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29
The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess.

SCSI means ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}.  Lumping
everything into SCSI as SCSI-1 is SLOPPY, WRONG, and DUMB.  Inconsitant
SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 usage is also a problem.  Clean it up now or have
a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle
slapped 'SCSA' an their own monitor inteface {SCSI IS standarized unlike
SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology.}

We had the same problem in our company. We changed the keyboard-bios and
after that, everything went fine. Our dealer told us that some boards of
that series have a defect kbd-bios.

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the
modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by
the modem.

Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other
hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport 
( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,
you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be
used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.

Nntp-Posting-Host: camelot.bradley.edu
Organization: Bradley University
Lines: 33


Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a few
changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.
(The card is revision 5A)

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus.

The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does?

To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line?

On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
chart, but that is it.

If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.

The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly
from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

Here is an example of how to do this:

/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */

/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port

 * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.
 * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.

Okay, here is my configuration:

12MB RAM 
WD212MB IDE HD ( drive C: )
ST3144A 125MB IDE HD ( drive D: )
Adaptec SCSI 1542B controller, with SCSI BIOS enabled
Seagate ST296N 80MB SCSI drive

Alrighty, when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message, but it says
something like:

""Drive C: installed""
""Drive D: installed""
""ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed!""

And I can't get to the Seagate drive.

I go into PhoenixBIOS setup, remove the entry for drive D:, and BOOM, I can
access the Seagate.  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate
at the same time?  I have ASPI4DOS.SYS, but it just hangs the system.

I did this.  I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge
switch.  This way, if the relay breaks, my drives will still work.

It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the
drive switch will work correctly for some programs.

I recently bought a Leading Edge 80386DX-33 <mini tower case> and everything
works fine. Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. I would
tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be
wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard.
Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.
Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that
whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were
doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the
SVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally
yourself.

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as
I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller
Mdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as
master Drive.  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives
while coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ).

So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assure
you it works with RLL.

There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive.  Any ""built-in"" drives e.g. IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I
have seen a similar situation before.

Good Luck

Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port
0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
""0"" for output, ""1"" for input).

The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might
have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.


Any information would be greatly appreasiated.

Hello,

I already tried our national news group without success.

I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC
with a normal TEAC drive.
I already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted
pin 6 (5.25""/3.5"" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins
8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.
The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light
stays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,
but I can't access it.
The TEAC works fine in a normal PC.

Are there any points I missed?

Thank you.

   Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will
automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high
IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. 
   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1
on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of
the interrupts in between. Works just great.
   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that
details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the
higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.

  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the 

first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- 
especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no
problems.

'lo all,

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration.
It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network.  (Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all
the info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  I
already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver.

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it.

  Thanks in advance,

Andy

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.

So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA.

The Adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering.  This means that the CPU
doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other
computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS
just sits and waits anyway.

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE
was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is*
ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA -
8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.

This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast
slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA
speed.  Heck, that's what ISA slots do - I'll just use one of those
instead.

Windows NT already supports SCSI, a variety of adapters, for disk,

IDE does not do DMA.  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk
interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not
compatible.

Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble.

(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the
last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it
would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)

That figure (1/4"") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...
on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12"").

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to ""factory-spec"" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15"" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a ""perfect"" monitor
(the definition of ""perfect"" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).

>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was ""normal""). The short answer is no, don't accept these
""imperfections"" as ""normal"" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated]
>8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.
If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.
There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and
the software.  THAT IS IT.
Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.

SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}

SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from
 SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs
 this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers
 AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 
 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}

SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things
 over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the
 machine and the external device.
 Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver
 software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.
 Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.

SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this
 requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING
 devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY
 expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts
 

As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the 
controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to
only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}

Well, it all depends on the motherboard implimentation.

Hi,

I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software
others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone 
claims..)

Anyway..

1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900
SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine
already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found 
out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. 

But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly
little use..

2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design
of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??

3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit
) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed...
(Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)

4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM
on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... 

For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available
from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc...
What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...

I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll 
suspect not .. 

5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????
   As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls
   0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on
   entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given 
   conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to
   screen memory in terms of portability?

Subject: Help on hand scanners wanted
Organization: University of Northern Iowa
Lines: 30

Fellow netters,

I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has
one.  I have my eye on two choices.

Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.

Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149).  

Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the
best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices.  Which should I buy?

If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range
(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help
would be greatly appreciated.

>The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon.

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was
the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just
been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed
several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the
Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last
year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the
ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I
scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it
scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.

Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading
reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product
testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly
know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of
what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell
anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
don't also understand the scoring.

You need a monitor cable that has a VGA connector on one end and five BNC
connectors on the other.  I bought one from Nanao when I bought the Nanao
monitor I use, which also has five BNC connectors.  Check with a computer
store that sells good monitors.  Quite a few companies use that setup.

Yeah.  Sounds typical.  Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,
and therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when
acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I 
imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,
and sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I can't even run in 
medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI
machine which places extra demands on the data bus.

Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II

(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format
5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5""HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with
many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken

also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II

At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS

I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now.
Actually, I had one that wouldn't connect to ANYTHING no matter
what software I used, so I got a new one sent to me.  This allows
me to connect to my favorite News system with ZERO problems.  So
I'm somewhat happier ....

But I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind
of reliability.  I have success about 1/10 calls.  Not good!  I
would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least
ONE of my fave places means I just need to adjust it.

What I usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response
line on the dial window. Sometimes it will drop to full screen mode
first, then I get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  In both cases the
modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier.

I am using DEFAULT settings (AT&F) and getting this problem.  I
am using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with
my copy of Qmodem (ATW1&C1&D2S95=44&W0) and getting this problem.
(They have refused to help me beyond this, claiming ""it must be
the BBS"" or something like that.  Not so -- my work modem connects
to this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a Microcom.)

Anyone have any ideas?!

  The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode,
which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800
does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should
be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),
since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with
the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using
standard palette.

  BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs
vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to
take it myself).

>Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?

  I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA
chip it uses though.

  Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got
for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as 
documentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller 
card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB)

I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes,
however in the 17"" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black

There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much
expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it
from someone else.

However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.
This is because the MPU used ""speed buffering"" instead of having a
16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the ""speed buffering""
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

Hope this helps...

Get back to your vendors, or better yet the board manufactures and get

   Where made.
   Norton indexes (yeah I know BMs suck but whats a mother to do?)
   number of slots, and types, # ESIA and # 32 bit?
   Any IDE or SCSI on board?
   How easy to upgrade RAM, location and # of pins.
   OVERDRIVE?
   Oscilator kits?
   Does it have a 16550 UART?
   Who's BIOS?

These might make you feel better about either system, but I must

How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel
active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.
So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how
all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.

Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,
but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):

""The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board
direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.""
I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  
So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT
HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense.

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer
to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be
programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this)

Besides, like I said before, the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2.
And I don't yet believe that the HDD controllers (any of them, MFM, RLL,
etc) don't also use DMA.

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be
the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard
is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very
poorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such
as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of
time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.

Back to comm software... I find success with TELIX (my COM3 at 3e8/5
works ok on TELIX).

	Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible
with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA
implementation really is.

	From what I've seen, the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz
intelligent bus (ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like,
not jumpers...)  Hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA 
Zorro III bus....

Greetings,

        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info,

and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.

        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big

1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?
2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?
3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? 
I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?
What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?
Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if
I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- 
quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.

Any input is welcome.

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the
menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in
PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called. 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred
them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).

- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and 
pronounced the disk drive unusable.

My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).
When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.

I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Install will proceed ""successfully"", but when I try to boot the server, it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one
disk drive (or at least one large single unit). 

Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready
errors.

Questions:
=========
The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen
SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II
(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what
is causing my serialisation error?
2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of
which has failed?
3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?
4. What else can cause a serialisation error?
5. What happens if the keycard fails?
6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments
and guides.

Thanks for your time.

Apology:

I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm
dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting
my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system

>How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?

By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)

Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use
the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crash.(I forget)

Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are
16-bit.

The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.

I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.

In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.

I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.
I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel.

Thanks.

They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use
IRQ7!.
     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes
me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,
then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel
printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore
no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,
thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.

     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not
route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software
usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port
activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably
getting the sound card slighty confused!.

Windows may be a different story....

because the noise in the line (I can actually hear it).  So my question is
will an error correction protocol help to eliminate this garbage?, my modem

A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion, so
he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would
bet it's a common problem.  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors
is to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model)
since monitor manufacturing even from ""Big Names"" still tends to produce
alot of monitors with visible defects.

The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems.
If your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper
block from jp5. This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x.
 
This is what my manual says about jp5. I never knew that it was there

Some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a Sony
with a 24x that the monitor can't handle. Or installing 60ns simms and
then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state
adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought!

Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a 
clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock
hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The
Get Date call notices that a ""midnight reset"" flag has been set, and then
then advances the date.

Anybody with more info?

Hai,

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.
It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.

My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:

	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
	  support (text & graphics)
	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	- Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.


For the people in Holland:
Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg
is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!

 Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to
 leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're 
 putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.
  Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.
 You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,
 etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save
 a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't
 look like much when it come time to fix your computer.

Is VLB busmastering bad because it stops the processor fetching from
external cache as well as main memory while the VLB card has the bus?
How significant is the slowing effect?

Hi all,

  I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is:

   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD
   * SCSI(2) Interface
   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B
   * Does not need any caddies
   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)
   * Double Speeded

  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,
  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions
  are sorted by my priority.
  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy
  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know
  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these
  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible
  with 1542B adapter.
  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33
to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux)
is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new
graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're
fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like
a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards
arrive, I'll buy one.

Over the last year I've done much the same. But now I need a 19"" monitor, more

I'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 'T' expanders
used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either
side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably) 
have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low
profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot, 
and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at 
each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.  

The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics
on it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system,
that may not be a problem.

Don't know about performance, though.  I'll leave that discussion to the 
engineers.

It doesn't have to have graphics, text only will do

But you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart,
jumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so

no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic),
but some info regarding what you said above.  I don't know about the 8250 or

I can also tell you that I'm one of those who won't buy a UART made by
anyone other than National Semiconductor.

7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button

Hi!

I think VGA-Copy can do what you need. 
If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4""), turn on
the ""modify"" switch of vga-copy.
When you boot using this diskette, a message appears:

This is no system disk, you can
1) replace disk with another,
2) boot from Harddisk or
3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:)
Type your choice:

When you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: .
Seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks
in 3.5"" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5"" a: drive)

Hope that helps
Robert

P.S.: VGA-Copy is shareware, so it's easy to get. Newest Version seems to be 5.0 .

I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton).  I caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  I was
told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed.

I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem
as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't
know if I could tell the difference.

I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like)
and noticed no significant change in performance.

Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive
once.  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the
controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do
with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.

I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives
because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives, much more

Hello

I've got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card, but lacking suitable drivers

Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers? Address for an

80486DX without the mathematical coprocessor (FPU).

Actually, the 80486 you described above is 80486DX.
(There is no separate 80486 nor 80386, either).

This is for Intel processors. Does anyone have a complete

Someone Else, could you please comment on that. I have just bought
a Twincom 14.4DFi, which has a Rockwell chipset. It wasn't cheap
so I would like to hear of problems I'm likely to run into.

Phew, I was lucky! The Twincom internal version has a 550A and one

Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics.
And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at
8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically
designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen
IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times
it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When
you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it
at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,
none of them run at CPU speed.

The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to
a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to
get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.

>because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.

Maybe you need to go into \mach32\install and set a refresh rate for
1280x1024.  You might need to use custom monitor option.

According to what others have told me, the ST-296N is difficult to run at
the 1:1 interleave even though Seagate claims it.  I have a non-pc system
(don't ask what it is, you probably haven't heard of it) that is built

We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the
time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the
offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some
of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the
offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.

Reply-To: e.dierksen@att.com (Elliot Dierksen)
Organization: AT&T Tax Systems Development, Maitland FL
Lines: 36

I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK
I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation
is no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to
COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(

There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:
C1
C2
S2
P2
P1
G

The second bank is labeled ""IRQ"" and has the following labels:
5C
5S
4
3
3S
2C
2S

I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the ""G"" enables the game port and
the ""S2"" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I
have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that
this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t
know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

The F550iW is optimized for Windows.  It powers down when the screen
blanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it
meets all of the Swedish standards.  It's also protected against  EMI from
adjacent monitors.

hands on QA Plus (version 4.21, maybe others as well), it will let you write
the COMPAQ CMOS settings.  I know because I just did it. 

I was just about to search for such a diagnostic disk when my brother-in-law 
fixed an old DESKPRO with it.  You might try the simtel mirror FTP sites.

at one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.
Seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use the

get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)?

I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in

that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating.  Using

The last I heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate
family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time.
This was some months ago.

It's a shame.  The driver is the best memory manager I have found
ANYWHERE.  It doesn't require V8086 mode (like QEMM) so it works with
Ultima 7.  It doesn't take ANY memory (runs, then exits).

If only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable.

Most importantly, which Winbench version are you using?  On my local bus ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro, I've gotten various Winbench scores from 15.8 million to
31 million winmarks, depending on the version.  Winbench 2.5 gives the most
optimistic scores, 3.11 gives the least.  A winmark rating is meaningless
without a corresponding version number.

I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get
985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my
transfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
transfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface
got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to 
improve my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck
(although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). I am already running a big
main memory disk cache, so Im not really interested in this solution either.

I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning.  I took him at his word, and I

What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!  
AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to
be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted
again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.

I'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access

Does your Stealth 24 have a row of DIP switches on the back plane?

If so, you have the older Revision A board and the winmark results
are absolutely normal. The later Revision B board benchmarks at 13

What is the deal with the IDE transfer rates?  Is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything
even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.  These drives are 1:1
(non-interleaved), aren't they?

Here are the rates I get:

1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector
                    blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec

2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec

3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                     --------    ---------
   MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec

I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter,
through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see
anything like ""after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host""
(even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent
quotes from the manual:

  ""Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
   3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.""  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec
   maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87
   sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)

  ""Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected
   'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.""  (I take
   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)

  ""For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer
   RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface
   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,
   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers""
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the
requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess
you could call that a cache :-|).

So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a
measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

the flex-stuff said I was at 1024-256.  I solved it by entering

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

In addition to startup time, I leave things running because my PC doubles as 
a fax machine. 

However, this is off the original subject. I didn't get the replies on BIOS, 
CMOS, and DOS clock/date logic. All I know is that I've been running this way 
for many months and it is only recently, the last month, that I have noticed 
the intermittent clock problem. As I stated, it is not always the date that 
doesn't roll forward, sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes 
behind where it ought to be. 

When unattended, the following are generally running minimized in Win 3.1:

Clock, WinFax Pro 3.0, Print Manager, MS-Word 1.1, File Manager, Program 
Manager

A random screen saver is generally running too.

I have a Gateway 4DX-33V with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive A.  I
accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up, rather than getting
the ""Non-system diskette"" message, the machine hangs and the CMOS
gets overwritten (luckily, Gateway sends a print of the standard
CMOS settings with their systems).  This only happens with a box
of pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have, no other disks cause this
problem.  If I re-format one of the Fuji disks, the problem goes away.
I did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.

Anyone have any idea what is going on here?  Hardware problem?  A
virus that can't be detected?  The system reading in garbage from
the boot sector?

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.

> which one is better?

mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.
The working of both drivers is totally the same.

When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,
because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,
because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

Referring to the manual of my motherboard with AMI-BIOS, 10 beeps are a 
'CMOS Shutdown Register Read/Write Error', if the system stops after these
beeps. If the system continues, it is a 'Keyboard error'.

Hi,
   I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs

Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play
the FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info
on the SB midi port.

I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however
this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and
loss the of note velocity data byte.

I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments
may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to
have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone
has this book could they please mail me.

My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file

I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install 
COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put 
""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you.

Hi Netters,

As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.
People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.
(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. 
However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.

DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.

Here is my suggestion...

1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with
	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that
	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other
	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you 
	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)

2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95
	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I
	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!
	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with
	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It
	works great.  Not delays.  I think the ""A"" is better than ""B"" 
	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
	I am looking forward to being able to ""LOADHIGH"" the DD sw.  That
	has been an annoyance.

3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the
	effort to upgrade.

Just my $.02 ...

Regards,
Mark Bagdy

Buddy,

I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The
documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a
203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had
~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very
happy camper.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on
a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install.
The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed
region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.
	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files.  

If you have any more specific questions let me know.
Dan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40
MB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the
same product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either
product.

I am trying to put together a new PC with VESA Local Bus.  I would like
to get VLB cards for Video and SCSI but I have heard of a problem with
bus mastering controllers on VLB.  Something to the effect that they will
actually slow down a system.  Anyone heard of this problem?

Specifically, I am interested in the Ultrastor 34F VLB SCSI controller.
Before I shell out the bucks for this thing I would like to get the
straight scoop from someone who knows.  Does anyone have this controller?
Any problems with it?

you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini.
in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the 
associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable
32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives
and controllers support it !

1)  throw out WINDOZE
2)  install OS/2

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections.  For this reason, I use the
""factory defaults"" for position/size on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan
monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is ""detected"".

Hey folks.

Is it possible to short out your CMOS chip?  I think mine is fried.
These are the symptoms...

I have to do the following to get my computer (a Gateway 486DX33)
to boot...

    Turn the power off

    Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip

    Turn the power on

    Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error

    Set up the CMOS

    Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)

    Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1]

The computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible
but the floppy drives are not.

I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot,
I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I
simply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.

Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one?
Where?

Thank you for your kind attention.

Organization: Motorola Inc, Austin, Texas
Lines: 47


For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution
     Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits:

I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which
is bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr,
multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16
sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit
I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC
(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight
answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).

Other questions:

- Excuse my ignorance, but is ""Texel"" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM
  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?

- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the
  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)

Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my
uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,
educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end
TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something
else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.

Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED
these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably
directly to the email address below.

Thanks,

Koji

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU 
cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough 
to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on.  So far so good.

Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?

I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this
reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-
ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA
DMA.

Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using
mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter.

No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to
a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's
because they're implemented by a single card.

This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to
1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble
setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,
just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications

Every new chip set confuses them.

I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and
it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to
fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If
you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file
P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the
P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,
you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right
combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy
of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT
file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices
should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.
You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of
the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,
too.)

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my
knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the
Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the
numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing
with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the
8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use
benchmarks from ""unbiased"" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,
etc.

I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and

Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has
hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's
use of a hardwired ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then
sat on a tack"" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in
real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the ""Bart
Simpson optimization,"" in which you save the bitmap of the
most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a
screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a
second time in a row.  (We call it the ""Bart Simpson optimization""
because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he
could right ""I will not cheat on benchmarks"" a hundred times and be
done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)

Subject: Do the 2MB ATI Ultra Pro 16 and 24 bit Windows Drivers Work?
Organization: University of Texas at Austin
Lines: 35

Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI
Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the
Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,
and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it
was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply
amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).

One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers

it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

The system configuration is:

Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus

ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM

Hi!

One of the ASPI-drivers (I think it's the ASPICD) supports a /NORST
paramter, which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads. This
fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptec+tosh 
3401.

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM.

2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be.

   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).

3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.

   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   ""R"". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode.
   
   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one.

I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

Too right it does!

The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't
already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)
get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).

If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back
to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)

Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair
shop (though there are/have been DIY guides).

I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my
Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above
16M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a

No, VL-bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE.  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if
you hook it to VL-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two,

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.
	     
The only identification printed on the board is ""MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD""
across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.
Immediately below the words ""SERIAL NO"", but not in the box left for
the S/N, are the numbers ""1990 2 8"".

Does anyone have enough experience to report whether disk data
compression has any effect on the optimal disk sector interleave?
Offhand, I expect that the time required to decompress disk data
would increase the optimum disk sector interleave.

Hi.  I am trying to set up a Conner 3184 and a Quantum 80AT drive.  I have
the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work
the other way around).  I am able to access both drives if I boot from a 
floppy, but the drives will not boot themselves.  I am running MSDOS 6, and
have the Conner partitioned as Primary Dos, and is formatted with system
files.  I have tried all different types of setups, and even changed IDE
controller cards.  If I boot from a floppy, everything works great (except
the booting part :)).  The system doesn't report an error message or anything,
just hangs there.  Does anyone have any suggestions, or has somebody else
run into a similar problem?  I was thinking that I might have to update the bios
on one of the drives (is this possible?).  Any suggestions/answers would be
greatly appreciated.  Please reply to:

Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and
it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.

The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really
does stink.

There are two 'problems':
(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit
    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime, and
(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero
value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call.

   You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one
may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion
seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than
an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then
using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)

   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be
modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able
to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't
tried this, but that would be my guess...

				Robert Anisko
				anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com


...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper
to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the Falcon and
beyond, VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...

Subject: Multi I/O card with 16550 UART's
Reply-To: spart@cs.uq.oz.au
Organization: Department of Computer Science, The University of Queensland
Lines: 18

Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in
(rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?

My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).
It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.

Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with
16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so
it could co-exist with my existing card.

Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,
preferably Brisbane?

Thanks,
Geoff Green (spart@cs.uq.oz.au)

i've been using an identical setup, except for the tower config,
for several months now.  from previous discussions on the net,
the first thing to check for is DMA conflicts with other devices,
especically if you've got any funky ones.  next off, suspect
your tape - try a fresh one.  good luck !

From a recent BYTE magazine i got the following:

[Question and part of the answer deleted]

  If you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to
make.  On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and
connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232 
25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7;
2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25
connected.  To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to
connect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male
DB-25 connector.

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY

not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the
settings may destroy your hardware!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of
posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should
agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order
to update the list.

If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or
jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!

Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for.
If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of
cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set
65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).

Another statement (maybe right):
IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter
and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.

The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a
jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper
is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.

BIOS SETTINGS

BIOS setting for the M2614ET in my system is 667 cylinders, 33 sectors
and 16 heads.

> I was trying to set my IDE drive in the subject above to a slave drive for
> A Conner 170MB drive and contacting the support company gave me this answer (which works). The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive. SW1 has been set to On Off Off On (1-4) all along.

There are 6 switches on the switch block on these drives.  Only 4 of 
them have a use that I am aware of (from my M2624T manual):

Master/Slave        Master (*)      SW1-5 OFF
                    Slave           SW1-5 ON

IO Channel Ready    Disabled (*)    SW1-1 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-1 ON

I have no idea about the function of SW1-2 and SW1-6.  The values 
listed with a (*) are the factory default settings.

There are two sets of jumpers. A set of 5 and a set of
4. With the power and IDE connector toward you, the set of 5 is
numbered (left to right) J16 - J20  , and the set of 4 is numbered
(bottom to top) J22-J25. 

The only jumper of normal interest is J20. Jumper it for only
drive in a single drive system, or master drive in a dual drive
system.
 
Remove the jumper J20 for slave drive in a dual drive system. 

J19 is a dummy and may be used to store the spare shunt if the 
drive is configured for a slave mode.

Jumpers J17, J18, J24, J25 are factory reserved. Abnormal operation
may occur if jumpered.

Jumper 22 is sync spindle enabled/disabled  (open=disabled)
Jumper 23 is sync slave/master              (open=slave)
Jumper 16 is I/O Channel Ready              (open=disabled)

Link Options

   In order to install the Rodime Ro 3000A series drives the dumpers for 
the single/dual drive and LED operation on the drive need to be set as 
described in the relevant product specification.
   I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.
   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a
Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives 
when performing diagnostics.
   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way 
interface connector. They have the following functions and are described 
in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper 
described nearest the 40 way interface connector.

LK2: LED 
     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the
     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An
     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will
     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130
     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.

LK1: Dual Drives
     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,
     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.

LK4: Master
     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If
     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
     jumpered in this way.

LK5: IOChRdy
     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is 
     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per
     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally 
     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per
     second.

   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)
may be jumpered:

     Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.
     Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.
     Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.
     Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.

   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.

   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way 
connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected
by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the 
drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further
details.

I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says
the board is a ""391 WB/H.""  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine
also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether
the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.

	Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of.
My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays ""Parity Error --
System Halted"" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error
Checking to ""disabled"" or ""enabled"" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).
Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).

	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all
worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).

	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them
in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.

	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/
parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).

	CAN ANYONE HELP?

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  

Just my 2 cent.

I am no expert on this.  But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this.  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives.  When you  low level format it, the information itself is gone as well, I don't think you can get it back unless you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you.

	Hi everyone,
	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming 
in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep 
getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the 
program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so 
I can't seem to explain why it crashes.

All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and
after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  

Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions
that do not return anything??

I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like
Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the
right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.

If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a
time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are
running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task. 

The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.

> 4) Is it only for internal modems?

NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the UART on board.

I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied
with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the ""master"" drive
and which into the ""Slave""?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  
built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive  
425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your  
help!

As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you  
please tell me if I'm right..

1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are  
kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want  
it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  
adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  
quantum?

2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.
Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  
all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.

3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  
of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.

4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  
think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  
SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?

Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting? 
Any help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost...

the above quote SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip}

are we talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller
or 
are we talking about a SCSI-1 Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI-2 controller board.

thanks

I ran a 386-33 out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no
major effects (yeah, no case at all, MB sitting on a static bag)
other than the noise from the Poersupply it ran pretty good.
as for cooling problems I bought a 12-14 inch fan and  turned
it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard.

I did finally get a case though and I am still running the parts
with no ill effects.

I also had no kids to spill things on the MB> I had no cat leaving
hair on the MB etc. etc. on and on....

the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the MB cool

I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago.
getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.
I ran QA/PLUS, Check It, Diagnose, as well as several shareware
memory checkers. I had a total of 8 meg SIMM in my system.
these store bought/ shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't
place on a memory chip. Out of exahperation I came up with
the (now deleted) steps to find bad memory chips. I found 2
(moral : never buy memory stamped ""not for sensitive or critical 
applications"" on the back.
        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on. Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
in windows. I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/
shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is.

p.s. man my typing stinks today and I don't feel like futzing around with 
this line editor.

I received a Kaypro 286i computer (DOS) without a manual that 
describes the jumpers on the motherboard.  It came with
640KB and I up'd it to 1MB.  But the computer or setup does not
recognize the extra 384K. 

Does anyone know if this computer is capable of greater than 640K

Some specs:

I believe you are right.  Both SCSI and SCSI-2 support 8 devices on the bus
(normally that would be the host controller and 7 targets) each of which
may have up to 8 logical units (LUNs).

Has anyone connected a high-res, fixed frequency monitor to their PC?
I have a mitubishi monitor that does 1024x768 at 60hz, but won't do
any other resolutions.  All the video cards designed for this sort of

at the right resolution and frequency)?  I'd like to use a mono

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  E-mail, please.

[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.

If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned
into C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and 
change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E.

Check the jumper settings and CMOS setup, in particular the correct
number of cylinders and tracks
