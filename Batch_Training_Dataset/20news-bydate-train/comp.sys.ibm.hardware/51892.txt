{Send follow ups to comp.sys.mac.advocacy. Sorry about the header but the 
Pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and I gave up after a 
year of trying. This sheet is also available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu 
(36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare177.txt.}
Mac & IBM Info-Version 1.7.7

The reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the 
information out there, so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate 
about what they are saying about their machines.  Since computer technology 
is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will 
be lacking or incorrect on information.  So, please just don't say the sheet 
is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to 
make the needed corrections.  All prices are in US dollars.
To keep this data sheet organized please provide, if possible, article 
citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to 
a minimum.  As this is a general data sheet, keep the info provided simple so 
I can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others. 
Finally, keep the information relevant to the section corrected {For example, 
OS code in ROM is software contained in hardware, so no more of the 'but it 
is supported in OS disk software' data for the hardware section, please}. 
Thank you.
Note:  for proper reading off line this document should be in 9 point Monaco.

OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)
Mac
 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal 
representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment 
of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly.

IBM
 Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when 
emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this 
better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, 
Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.

Networking [Includes printing]
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.
Mac
Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for 
each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a 
network option since 1989.
Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can 
use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, 
Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing 
machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows 
typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version 
will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 
(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software 
built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.
Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.
 {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}

IBM  
Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.
Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk 
protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.
Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible 
with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to 
that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, 
{80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and 
offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more 
complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)
Printing {Very OS dependent}
DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
 and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next.
Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs" 
 in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they 
 are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like 
 and intelligent about this.
OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.
Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved.

Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features 
than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds.
The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  
built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and 
NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.
All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where 
noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card 
needed except for 24-bit color display}.
IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA 
monitor {VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, 
sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 
16-bit color, etc}.
Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {386sx/20MHz 
equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.
LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.
Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program 486sx/40 or 
'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a 
PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.
Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program 486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 
MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; 
$3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit 
color}

Final note: Since there is NO comp.sys.ibm.pc.advocacy group this has been 
posted to the closest relevent groups {comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy, 
comp.os.os2.advocacy, and comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc}.  Also since some Mac vs IBM 
articles have been showing up in comp.sys.mac.hardware I have included that 
newsgroup in the posting. {Don't site the comp.sys.mac.* FAQ as a reason not 
to post to comp.sys.mac.hardware, since the FAQ itself does not follow 
internet guidelines, especially the de-facto "[all] the FAQs for a newgroup 
hierarchy should be posted to ALL newsgroups in the hierarchy" standard.}
