<6.6> What is the FBI's proposed Digital Telephony Act?

  ``Providers of electronic communication services and private branch
  exchange operators shall provide within the United States
  capability and capacity for the government to intercept wire and
  electronic communications when authorized by law...''
  
  From `BBS Legislative Watch: FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted' by
  S. Steele in Boardwatch Magazine, Feb. 1993, p. 19-22:
 
  > In a move that worried privacy experts, software manufacturers and
  > telephone companies, the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
  > Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to
  > perform electronic wiretapping. The proposed legislation,
  > entitled 'Digital Telephony,' would have required communications
  > service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their
  > systems 'tappable' by providing 'back doors' through which law
  > enforcement officers could intercept communications. Furthermore,
  > this capability would have been provided undetectably, while the
  > communications was in progress, exclusive of any communications
  > between other parties, regardless of the mobility of the target
  > of the FBI's investigation, and without degradation of service.
  >  
  > ...under the proposal, the Department of Justice (DOJ) can keep
  > communications products off the market if it determines that
  > these products do not meet the DOJ's own ... guidelines. This
  > [could] result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for
  > service providers and equipment manufacturers, since they will be
  > unlikely to add any features that may result in a DOJ rejection
  > of their entire product. ...the FBI proposal suggests that the
  > cost of this wiretapping 'service' to the Bureau would have to be
  > borne by the service provider itself...
  > 
  > The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of
  > public interest and industry groups, from Computer Professionals
  > for Social Responsibilty (CPSR) and the ACLU to AT&T and Sun
  > Microsystems, to oppose the legislation. A white paper produced
  > by the EFF and ratified by the coalition, entitled, `An Analysis
  > of the FBI Digital Telephony Proposal,' was widely distributed
  > throughout the Congress.  ... The Justice Department lobbied hard
  > in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before
  > Congress adjourned, but the bill never ... found a Congressional
  > sponsor (and was therefore never officially introduced). The FBI
  > [may] reintroduce "Digital Telephony" when the 103rd Congress
  > convenes in January.

<7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?
 
  The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce
  Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical
  introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role
  of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of
  nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:

  > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its 
  > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for
  > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved. 
  > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now
  > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only
  > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of
  > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two
  > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,
  > possibly four million people use  this gigantic
  > mother-of-all-computer-networks.   
  > 
  > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is 
  > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late 
  > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it 
  > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped
  > up the pace of scientific research enormously.  
  > 
  > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular, 
  > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,
  > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at
  > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'
  > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling
  > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its
  > original base in military and  research institutions,  into
  > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries
  > and the commercial sector.

<7.2> How Internet `anarchy' like the English language?

  According to Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us>:

  > The Internet's `anarchy' may seem strange or even unnatural,  but
  > it makes a certain deep and basic sense.  It's rather like the 
  > `anarchy' of the English language.  Nobody rents English, and
  > nobody  owns English.    As an English-speaking person, it's up
  > to you to learn  how to speak English properly  and make whatever
  > use you please  of it (though the government provides certain
  > subsidies to help you  learn to read and write a bit).  
  > Otherwise, everybody just sort of  pitches in, and somehow the
  > thing evolves on its own, and somehow  turns out workable.  And
  > interesting.   Fascinating, even.   Though a lot  of people earn
  > their living from using and exploiting  and teaching  English,
  > `English' as an institution is public property, a public good.  
  > Much the same goes for the Internet.   Would English  be improved
  > if  the `The English Language, Inc.'  had a board of directors
  > and a chief  executive officer, or a President and a Congress?  
  > There'd probably be  a lot fewer new words in English, and a lot
  > fewer new ideas.

  Hopefully you have benefitted from this creation, compilation, and
  condensation of information from various sources regarding privacy,
  identity, and anonymity on the internet.  The author is committed
  to keeping this up-to-date and strengthening it, but this can only
  be effective with your feedback.  In particular, the following
  items are sought:
  
  - Short summaries of RFC documents and other references listed,
    esp. CPSR files.
  - More data on the specific uses and penetration of RFC-931.
  - Internet traffic statistics.  How much is email?  How much
    USENET?  What are the costs involved?
  - Famous or obscure examples of compromised privacy
    on the internet.
        - FTP site for the code (NOT the code) to turn the .plan file into a
                named pipe for sensing/reacting to remote `fingers'.
  - Knowledge on the `promiscuous' mode of receipt or transmission 
    on network  cards.
  - Details on the infamous experiment where a scientist resubmitted 
    previously accepted papers to a prominent journal with new and
    unknown authors that were subsequently rejected.
  - X Windows, EFF, CPSR FAQhood in news.answers.
  
  Commerical use of this document is negotiable and is a way for the
  author to recoup from a significant time investment. Email feedback
  to ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu.  Please note where you saw
