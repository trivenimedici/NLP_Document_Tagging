	However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX-PC'.  Also note the strange cross-posting (as he
probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on.  If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the ""2C"" jumper would be
the correct choice.

	I've left the cross-posting in effect, since I'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)

  Sorry for any confusion I may have created.  The disk did come out of
a VS2000 and I would like to use it in a IBM PC clone.  The reason that I
posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because I saw the drive (XT2190) mentioned
in a for-slae notice.  I had asked for info before but didn't receive
any replies.

  Thanks once again for the help.

  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 5.0. It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire.  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and anti-static bags. I am not sure if they were ever 
used, but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order. 
 
 $30 each plus shipping cost, (about $5), 
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs, this is for you !  It's cheaper

All comics are in near mint to mint condition, are bagged in shiny 
polypropylene bags, and backed with white acid free boards.  Shipping is
$1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
a large enough amount of stuff.  I am willing to haggle.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what

This car is extremely reliable, even better than the Toyota Corolla it
replaced.  Besides the tires, brakes and maintanence items, the only other
parts that have been replaced are the headlight bulbs.

Selling because my wife refuses to drive a car without an automatic trans.
And she wants a station wagon with a sun roof, etc, etc.

Hi All

I have a Korg DVP-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping.  For those who've not
had the pleasure:

It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice
processor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the
notes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one
time).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a ""computerized"" sounding
singer, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -
you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -
I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,
it takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4"" cables.  For output, you can have
a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset
setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple
of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we
don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.
The manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but
it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.

Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel

Asking for $500 or best offer...

I paid $697 for the whole package. And it is too late for me to get the 
refund. I would sell it for $500 for the whole package. Details could be 
provided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if 
you are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I don't care if you 
sell the camera to other for a higher price. If you are interested in 
the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.

Some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you 
are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out 
of five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as 
I did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't 
bother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could 
get it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package 
within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). 
Also, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay 
for the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than you
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.

For sale: Toshiba 3300SL notebook computer. 

Specs:

	80386SL (64K cache) @ 25MHz, * 8MB * RAM, 80 meg 16ms IDE hard drive, 
	1.44meg floppy, 5.9 lbs w/ Nickle Hydride battery installed, edgelit

        port, 1 PCMCIA port, external expansion port, external VGA port, 1
	serial, 1 parallel ports, socket for 80387SL numeric coprocessor
	(user-installable).   Memory is expandable to 18meg.

	Voted Editor's Choice by PC Magazine.   An expansion station is
	available from Toshiba; Axionics also makes one that is more
	economical.
	

Power conservation options: 

	User definable hard drive powerdown period, screen dimming,
        auto stepdown of CPU speed (to 12.5, 6 MHz) after definable interval,
	etc.

Comments:

        Purchased locally at Micro Center in Columbus, OH 7 months ago.  All
	original packaging, receipts, and manuals are included.   Under
        warranty.   The keyboard on this machine is the best I've seen; I
	prefer it to the keyboard on most desktop units. I typically
        get 3-4 hours of battery life.  The battery recharges in 2 hours to 
        full charge.   The machine is quite speedy; I run OS/2 2.1beta
	on it currently and will leave this operating system installed unless
	you prefer MS-DOS 5.0 (included).
   
        I'll include a padded carrying case, also made by Toshiba.

Price/terms:

	$1900 (semi-firm), certified check.    If outside of Columbus, I will
	pay for COD shipping.

FOR SALE!!!!

1) Sony Car Stereo Amplifier (Model XM-2040)
	Rated Power 20Wx4, into 4 Ohms from 20-20,000Hz @0.5%THD
	2 Ohm Stable
        Short Circuit and Overload Protected
 
This is a great little amplifier that I picked up as a demo model at Lechmere
last spring, and never got a chance to install. It's been tested, and it 
works great...a perfect amplifier for adding 4-speaker power to a system, or 
for powering mids or tweets...whatever. Mounted on a board, complete with a 
RS 15 Amp noise filter, with all connections made to barrier strips for easy 
screw-type contacts. Lists new in Crutchfield for $129, am asking 
			$75 O.B.O complete


2) Sony Electronic Crossover (Model XEC-500)
	Freq Response 5-100,000 Hz (+0,-3 dB)
	S/N Ratio 105 dB (A wtd.)
	High Pass X-Over @flat,80,120,180 Hz (12dB/octave)
	Low Pas X-Over @50,80,120,180 Hz (18dB/octave)
	1/2 DIN size for In-Dash Installation in many cars!

This to,l is an exceptional unit which I found extremely useful  back in the 
days when I had a car to put a stereo in. Two sets of RCA-type inputs (F/R), and Three sets of Outputs (F/R/Sub) Each output with seperate level control. 
variable Low Boost control (+10 dB@40 Hz) for extending low bass, and seperate High and Low pass crossover points make this a great unit for anybody who's 
interested in building a Sub/Satellite type system 
	
	Used with orig. box&Papers $130 O.B.O
	 

Both units work flawlessly, and are in excellent shape cosmtically (ie No 
scratches, etc.) Anyone who is interested, please respond to 
	
	coates@wpi.wpi.edu

I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have...oh yeah if you want both
I'll sell the Amp with th X-Over for $175 or so...Thanks

A very good R&B group came out in 1988 called the Pasadenas.  I bought their
cassette single and fell in love with it.  I've tried to find their LP
or CD but have had no success whatsoever.  Just wondering whether anyone
out in Netland had heard of them....

their song that hit the charts was called Tribute...

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
02106@brahms.udel.edu

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by
mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

Organization: Freshman, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA
Lines: 30
NNTP-Posting-Host: po5.andrew.cmu.edu

I am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale.  

I purchased 256 T-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. 
We didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  I have about 175 shirts
left and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts,
even in bulk)  (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  These shirts are Jim
Morris T-shirts.  They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4
colors.  (They are clean and neatly folded in a box.  If any happen to
be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it, your option.)  You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece
(the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school
event or a organization.  I realize it is a big investment, but it could
pay off big.

I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a
shirt.  I will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power.

Please help me.  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need
the money.  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap.  I will give
you Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices.

All prices are negotiable.

--Truman

Please email tf26@andrew.cmu.edu and tell all of the clubs in the area
about this deal.  Once they're gone, they're gone (cause I am not a
business.)

apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. If anyone

Lines: 273

I have an Altos 2000 System V.3 Unix system for sale (I actually have two,
but one's for me). Several years ago these well-known machines sold for
$30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than the
base configuration, depending on what you want:

- 386 16 MHZ CPU.
- 8 meg of ram.
- Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!
- A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!
- Ethernet.
- 5.25"" floppy drive.
- QIC 24 cartridge tape drive.
- 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want).
- Unix System V.3 installation.
- Networking software package (TCP/IP).
- Development system software package (C compiler and libraries).

I am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet or
serial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total of
three ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive.

This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originally
designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.
This is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it's
very fast and exceptionally reliable.

It's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8"" wide and 2"" deep.

I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.
Shipping is way too much hassle. Call if you wish, or send email.

I still have about 70 records left on hand, all in pristine condition
(except where noted), quite a few out-of-print and more than a few
imports in the bunch.

Rather than selling the majority for $3-4 each, I'm looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over USENET.  I'll also
trade for other records in very good condition that you've replaced
with CD, as well as pre-recorded videos on Beta or VHS.  In the past,
I've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list/store price
(e.g., 1 CD = 1 movie in Beta format*) to get around what you or I
might have originally paid (as if we can even remember!  (-;) **

[At this time, I'm looking for a set of working AA NiCad rechargable
batteries ... if you have some lying around, and they're sound, RSVP!]

So if you're curious, RSVP for my list and if you see anything that
you like, send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff you're selling ... thanks!

gld

* i.e., the imports and out-of-prints are also valued at 1 used CD;

** I once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records (list $81);
Anybody got a nice, unused blender for making frozen margaritas? (-;

PS: There have been NO additions since the last posting in February;
        the list has only shrunk as I've made a few deals since.

	as well as racing pinion.  The chassis is nicked up from hard running,
	but it's still a great car.  Does not include electronics.  Comes 
	with monster truck conversion kit (wheel arms already installed)-virgin
	truck body and bumper etc.  Car+kit=$100+20=$120 OBO...make an offer!

D&D stuff...you name it, I probably have it.  Please send email regarding what

This package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted
to cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth
which I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as
close as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...

Nishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended
			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring
			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four
			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm
			film.

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift.

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.
			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is
			_not_ included.

Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.
				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not
				included. The voucher is good for all 3
				locations, but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once.

Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and
			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as
			usual.

I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you
make your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell
the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift.

If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. 
Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is 
only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them 
back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three 
months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.

Sony B+W 2.5 inch TV.  It is in excellent condition.  It has not
been used much at all, thus why I am selling it.  It gets great           $60

Hey,

collection.  I am interested in buying any in good condition.  I am 
particularly interested in any of the older, exotic models (eg five ] 
transformers into one etc...  I am looking at paying around $20-$40 depending
upon the model, size and original cost etc.  I will also pay airmail postage
and packing.  I am also happy to buy any old sci-fi related toys eg robots,
rocketships, micronauts etc... There is only one catch.  I live in New
Zealand so you have to be willing to post the items there.  I hop that
someone can help me out.

Computer Equipment Garage Sale:

I've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and
indicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I
am very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for
some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy 
disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically 
anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  
Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... 
I really want to get rid of this stuff...

Ok, Here's the list:

52 Meg 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy
	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem 
	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The
	guy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk 
	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) 
	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to 
	him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) 
	so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't
	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45

52 Meg 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.
	I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different
	model numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD
	(I have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45

40 Meg SONY 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism 
	is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and
	had a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the
	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which
	was not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller
	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a 
	project.	~$20

65 Meg Seagate 5.25"" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought
	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that
	I could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,
	and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending
	proper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, 
	looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I
	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
	drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good
	at soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed
	up.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on
	me.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,
	worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,
	Excel, and many others) 
	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all
	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only 
	ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry
	when I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't 
	have time to play with it any more.	~$65

AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know
	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I
	have some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an
	AT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  
	working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how 
	this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.

Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone 
	is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I
	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the
	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without 
	another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the
	prices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.	~$65

CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although
	I think I was using a bad monitor)	~$5

5.25""	360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, 
	because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!		~$25

5.25"" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to 
	work.  Came out of same PC as above.	~$25

5.25""	Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't
	even know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have
	any method of testing them.
		Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another
			number on it: 2626-361723.
		Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also
			another number on it: H3649-101457
		Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one 
			above.
	Each Drive ~$10

3.5"" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I
	think it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I
	suppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number
	DFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35

MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way
	of testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit
	card with a floppy controller built in.	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for
	the 16-bit card w/floppy.

Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,
	standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.
	D1181-80020		~$10



I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many 
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I 
usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) 
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.

Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you 
can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate
to throw away stuff...

Summary: Adaptec 1640 SCSI MC controller $250!!
Reply-To: d32x@vax5.cit.cornell.edu
Keywords: adaptec 1640 scsi-2 mc busmaster
Distribution: misc.forsale

I'm selling an Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card.  I works with Microchannel
machines only.  The data transfer rate is very fast (I get about 3meg/sec with
my SCSI hard drive), and that's with relatively slow 100ns RAM on a card.  It's
a SCSI-2 true bus mastering/DMA device, and goes for around $329 bought new. 
I'm including the new EZ-SCSI software for speedy Win 3.1 performance and easy
configuration.
I'm selling it for $225, and I'll pay the COD shipping.

Please email me directly, and either give me your phone # with your offer, or
I'll respond with mine.  I hope we can both benefit from the sale of this
Microchannel device; it's a great product!

I have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer
made. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,
heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have
been able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and
sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera
did. This is my, ""never be without a camera"" camera. The current
water-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed.

Recently I got a case of Hot Shots '93 cards.  Unfortunately I had
not planned on keeping all of them.  I sort of got stuck with the
case.  (I'm not going to mention any names, though.)

So, I am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).

If you have any interest in a set, a box, or any singles, please let
me know.

The set has 250 cards.  Each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress.  Some nude, semi-nude, lingerie, dressed.
99 percent are gorgeous, I feel.

There are 4 subsets:

Girl, Girl, Girls   1 through 9
Promo cards   251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)
Emperor's All-Stars   269 through 277
Stripping Empress   260 through 268

Also, I am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.

Oh, and lastly, I have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the
company changed their mind.  None of these cards are easy to get.

Anyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please
drop me a line, as I am most eager to sell a bunch off.

Oh, and if you are interested, I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92
left, and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well.

And lastly, I have promo cards for all of the cards I have

I have an 8000S I'd like to sell.  Now that I'm finished with my TAing,
I don't have nearly as many appoints to miss, and I'd like to put the
money toward a laptop.

Asking $200.  I bought it last Christmas.  It's in great shape and

I've got 2 sets of sample cd's for sale

set one (2cd's)-geared towards house/techno/pop and rap

The 1st cd is all drum loops and drum sounds over 1500 of them
The second contains analog synths, basses, bass loops,  wavestations, vox
loops and much much more. 

The second set-

A variety of different sounds from new age to rock etc... kind of a
sampler cd..(pardon the pun)

Both have never been used and I can supply a list of categories for the
sounds if someone is seriously interested.

I'd like 130 for all three as they were $200ish new...

Organization: Mississippi State University

Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 18:48:06 GMT

This drive is less than one year old.  The cartridges have all been bought
since then.  All is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
Due to a change in system use, I now need a large, contiguous drive.

Offer includes:
	SyDos 44i internal drive
	SCSI adapter card and cables
	All original documentation
	Software
	All original packaging
	8 cartridges totalling over 350Mb (no bad sectors or defects)

The installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.

I will trade for something near 300Mb IDE, or sell for $450.
I will also consider trading for 4 4Mx9 30 pin SIMMs at 70ns.

Howdy All!

I have recently converted to Microsoft Visual C++.

I no longer want my Borland C++ 3.1 w/Application Frameworks product.

This version is about 6 months old. I have all of the manuals, disks (5.25""),
etc. It is licensed to me but I will transfer the license to the purchaser
under the accepted terms of the Borland license agreement.

I also have a copy of the books:

""Developing Windows Applications with Borland C++ 3"", James McCord, Sams (39.95)
""Using Borland C++ 3 2nd ed"", Mark & Lee Atkinson"", Que  (29.95)

I'd like to do is sell it all to the highest bidder under the conditions listed
below.

I'll ship C.O.D. to anywhere in the U.S. via the shipper of your choice
(provided they are local to me), and I will pay the COD charges (you just pay
for the shipping).

The list price for the product is about $750. I have seen it advertised for as
low as $500. 

I will accept the best offer over $375 (plus shipping as described above) which
is 1/2 the list price, plus, I'm tossing in the 2 books listed above (which are
a $70 value).

I will hold the bidding open through the weekend and close it sometime in the
evening of 4/26/93.

Please reply via eMail. Only serious offers please apply. No, I will not
consider anything for trade, nor any offers less then $375 as I consider it a
fair price.



Regards,
Steve.

It's basement cleaning time.  This stuff has got to go.

I have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box.  They are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up.  They've seen
very little use.  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours
for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee.

I have a lot of serial cables.  I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long,
short M-M, M-F whatever you want.  Most appear to work well with PC serial
ports, but I will not gaurantee that.  Tell me what you want and I'll do
the best I can to match.  1.50 ea or 10/$10.  Shipping included.  No CODs
under $20.  (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable?  Go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.)  I believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center.  They appear
to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well.

I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably
a logic board.  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think
they used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you 
need to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels.

I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.

 I'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. The group is Sanford/Townsend
the name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' (I think). This album
came out somewhere around  1975-76, and I believe was the first album produced
by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up.

If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it, great. If
you don't want to part with it, but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd
love that too.

++++++++++++++++++++++++ CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE +++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale:

(2) Old-Style Rockford Fosgate 150's.  These are great amps, and I've never
    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on
    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell
    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already
    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked
    in cars.

    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was
    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit.


(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,
    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.
    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into
    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well.

    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on
    it.

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

Subject: Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer for sale
Originator: rob@snoopy.msc.cornell.edu
Organization: cluttered-but-in-order
Lines: 71


Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:
I have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more ""digital"".
Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:
  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds
  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source
  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity
    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.
  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings.
  o A 3.5"" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot
    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.
  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device
  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly ""page-driven""
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1
    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on
    the SQ-80.

This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while
now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer
(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.

>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped
short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80
is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.
Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most
good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it
works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.
This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have
an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain
to use so I have avoided it.

REASON FOR SALE:
I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual
here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard.

PRICING AND TERMS:
I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept
$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of 
patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the 
original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.

Price:    Asking $650.00 (everything)
Shipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states

HE IS A CROOK.  DON'T DEAL WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please Help:

I am looking for Dana Weick.  A month ago I made a deal with him over the
net.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.
I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  

I sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.
I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.

I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or
what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)
He never reply my mail.  

I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get
throught, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.
I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had
send out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it
to.  

He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.
To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he
never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every
of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)

Now:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still
      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.

So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.
he can be reach at:

(602) 925-6123 (days) (602) 842-2145 (evenings)

I would prefer US Mail, 2nd Day Priority (it only costs $2.90)

The CPU is brand new, install it correctly (meaning don't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins) and I'll warranty it for 6 months.
Thanks

****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID...
that I got the cod payment.
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
>Is the CPU sent out yet?
****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9

Glad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it.  Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real
sympathetic! 
 
If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, 
DON'T GUESS!


********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************

I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was 
busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house
went by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-
nected.

Since this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA
WEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now.  And he is getting away
with it.

I am currently searching for old video tapes of music groups of the early
80's to the late 80's.  At first I requested VHS formats, but now i'm accepting
either VHS, 8MM, OR BETA.  The type of format i'm interested in are the
type that most nite clubs or trendy clothing stores play.  If you do have any
of these tapes just send me a reply with a few groups listed, i'll reply back
if the groups listed are the type i'm searching for.  I'll gladly pay you what
they are worth or trade for other movie or music videos, thanks.

Tom.

	No, I or my friends with me now have not delt with him, but we
did try to call him, and there's no answer at his phone.

	The call was made at midnight EST; God knows what time that is

	We'll try again later.

I have a Sherwood stereo receiver which I received as a gift, and would
like to sell, as I already own a system.  It is the Sherwood model RX-4010R
It is brand new, still factory sealed.  This is a high quality surround-
sound amp ( 160 Watts, 250 Watts Dynamic Headroom Power ), very highly
rated by Consumer Reports ( March, 1993 ).  Has 4 audio inputs, and Pre-amp
and Main-amp connection jacks for added flexibility.  Includes 2-year
factory warranty.  Comes with remote. 

Asking $210

I need to sell two pairs of BladeRunner in-line skates (we don't use them).
One is size 9 and one is size 12.  They are less than a year old and were
used very little, generally in the Corridor.  They are in very good
condition.

They sell at Lechmere for $99.98 (we still have the boxes, if you want
them) and we'd like to get $85/OBO for them.  Please respond by

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs
a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic
features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am 
putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS 
magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping
included.

WinSong for Windows:

Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.

It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move
and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.

It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.
Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward
and stop.

It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,
saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.

You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual
is handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect.

Almost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered
$70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)
