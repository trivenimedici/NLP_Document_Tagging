I've seen this problem several times. It was always the result of the little 
rollers inside the mouse becomming dirty- they are good at collecting grime.
the solution is simple: remove the ball to reveal the two rollers. 
Carefully clean them and the ball.

I think you would need a DOS macro program.  Superkey (by Borland?)
comes to mind.  I don't think Windows is capable of sending
keystrokes to a DOS window.

What you want to do sounds like a security problem to me, though.

Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to ""print to a file"", with
output as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file
to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the
document at 600 dots per inch resolution.

I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from
an image processing program that can output images in Postscript.

Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)
doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver
does have a pull-down menu for ""resolution"", but the only choice given in the
menu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.

Any ideas?

Subject: Setting up a SLIP client under DOS and Windows (long)

Summary: How to get SLIP going on your PC ....
Keywords: SLIP, PHONE, CSLIPPER, WinQVT/net


I have been posting monthly ""how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC"" posts for a 
few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of 
posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.

This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota
PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with 
PHONE. 

For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at
<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>

Best wishes,

-- begin SLIP.TXT --
Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here
are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the
Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring your Modem:

a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)
   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use
   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program
   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit
   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.
   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.

   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a
         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.

b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done
   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of
   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the
   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and
   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with
   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver
   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a
   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.
   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and
   batch file examples.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring the SLIP drivers:

There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available
CSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver
SLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver
SLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)
ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)
UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)

Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or
ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:

a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART
b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others
   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a
   long FTP transfer.
c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode
d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with
   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.

Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)
a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:
   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1
   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600
b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the
   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual
   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS
   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all
   use this virtual driver at 0x60.
   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in
   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.
   pktint.com

Instructions for SLIP8250.COM:
a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern
   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware
   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.
b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a
   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.
   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600
c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x
   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM
   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM
   pktint.com

Instructions for ETHERSL.COM:
If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You
will have to DELETE the line ""device=*vcd"" from the [386Enh] section
of SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm
applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not
recommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:
   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring Windows 3.1:

a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]
   section.
   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.
       COM1Base=03F8
       COM1Irq=4
       COM2Base=02F8
       COM2Irq=3
       COM3Base=03E8
       COM3Irq=5
       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,
       but double-clicking on the ""Ports"" icon.
   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer
       COM1Buffer=10000
   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish
       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that
       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to
       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch
       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value
       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.
       COM1AutoAssign=0
       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.
       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under ""Device Contention"", set
       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to
       ""Never Warn""
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional notes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each
SLIP session?

I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user
a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI
each time that I establish a SLIP connection.

If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,
please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the
configuration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP
will not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a
situation such as this, you must do the following:

Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:

[net]
name=
ip=
netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)
arptime=20
packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)

Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file
""attrib +r qvtnet.ini""

Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address
that you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the
general configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and
IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],
and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not
be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.

A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address
assignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)
Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.
Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a
file called ""myip"".  Another file ""noip"" is essentially a complete
QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step ""myip""
and ""noip"" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of
Victor's batch file is provided below:
=====================================================
slipper com2
pktint.com
bootpq -i ""ip=\""%%s\""""  >> myip
bootpq -i ""My IP# is: %s""
copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini
del /q myip
@echo off
echo .
echo Ready to run WinQVTnet
=====================================================
For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor
Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)

QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?

PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes
immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM

PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet
simulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:

The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you
use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).

[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]

lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)
lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)
lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)
lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)
pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)

Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
Windows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is
directed to the file ""popmail.bat"".  This is what popmail.bat reads
like:

pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60
cd \popmail
popmail
cd \
pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60
exit                    causes the DOS window to close

I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications
like PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS
sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example
within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for
Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each
instance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?

I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with
a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these
conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows:
a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session
b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session
c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS

I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring
compressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with
SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session
is active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session
is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same
files.

While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,
for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the
performance hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode

In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the
applications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3

When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,
I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads
""IP:incorrect packet type"" or ""IP:bad version number"".  This does not
seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on
loss of performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with
C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?

In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --
Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him
know.  Chances are that he can fix it.

In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is
kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2

(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)

I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate
ETHERSL.COM

This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a
packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box
at a time.

So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library
of Medicine).

ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP
cd \gm6
search
cd \
termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP
exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows

If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have
any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing
the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no
problem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no
problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PHONE Script Files:

The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on
writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than
the University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script
that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.

Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,
and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP
session with the following command ""slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu"",
followed by my password -- again.

Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -

How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?

The quick answer -- there is no ""clean"" way.  Below is a batch file
hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this
example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use a
batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,
port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,
CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory
or in your path ...

All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection
using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the
connection, and unload the driver when you are done ...

-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --
@echo off
rem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn. ""SLIP.BAT""

I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 3.1
to open a dos box.  When I am done with the dos box, I cant get back to windows.
If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes
black and I have to control-alt-delete until I kill windows.  I get a couple
of screens about app not responding.

I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alt-tab
to cycle through the running apps, I get flashes of text but then the
black returns.

This persists even if the machine is powered on and off.

I am working with an app developed using Borland's 3.1 application frameworks
and c++.  It seems to work fine.

Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network.  Video is a TSENG 
vga.  dos 5.0.

I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back.  I am
using temporary swapping for virtual memory.

I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer.

Thanks,

Well, this is *only* a guess:  If it goes by the ""true"" meaning of ""bit

I had this problem when I initially installed my sound blaster pro and here's
what the tech support told me.

They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from
the win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory. Now look in the system.ini
file and if any of them say device=xxxxxxx.386 than change it to 
device=*xxxxxxx
Thats should work. Was your system.ini file erased for some reason? That would
be the only reason that I would think that Windoes is giving you the error now.

Why is Win 3.1 sometimes so finicky?
I have a new DELL 486DX2/66mhz  8 megs RAM.
Windows was working just great.  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem.
DELL replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard.  Just prior to this problem windows would
]only load up every other time.  I would get the LOGO and either it would
go on into windows or LOCK UP.  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME.

Now with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing.
The computer is less than one month old.  At first it worked FINE!
I can get into windows each time now with the   win/s command.
This forces Standard mode.  Things seem to run slower.  I mainly
use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....
plus it is slower.

I re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing.  Should I first delete
everything in all windows dir's?  I did not because I have so much 
added in sub dir's etc.

Really puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently
every other time.  Standard mode each time......

ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ???

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? 

Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?

Come on fellows! The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals.
It's in the ""Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures,
and Macros"" (MSC-Dev.kit for 3.1, should be also in the Borland's
manuals) pages 232-241 (depending what you need).

First there is the BITMAPFILEHEADER-struct then the BITMAPINFO which
contains the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the RGBQUAD and then the bitmap
data. AND there is also a example among the example files (MS_SDK).
Hope this helps....

Subject: SUMMARY:  Canon BJ200 vs. HP DeskJet 500
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 401


Hello again,

About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the
Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people
asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I
received.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have
not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so
you can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an
unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a
wide range of comments, each has its own value.  

There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its
price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability
of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new
printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around
summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first
inkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of
re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely
depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets
(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,
that's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!

Well I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebate
program on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from Computer
Discount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere I
looked, and I think it's a HOT printer.  Just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the
output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my
BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed
how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was
several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the
HP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).

I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders
too.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY
was two days.

Good luck!

===========================================================================

I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using
TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for
the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find
copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows
driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few
'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType
but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless
the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges
can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.

For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via
the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as
'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The
range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.

>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.

However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
Epson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing
laser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX
- something I think?

I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The
introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.
 
===========================================================================

About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is
incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from
Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've had
are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on
cheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you
can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve
inches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The
printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other
complaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for
those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.
The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it
between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine
from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend
who has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone
has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!

Hope I helped!

(360dpi sure looks great!)

  I guess I have some experience with both: I have a BJ-300 at work and a
Deskjet 500 at home.  I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality
are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet
for home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM
Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.

  Just my $0.02 worth..

  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not
present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the
translation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the
note.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around
the paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics
resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:
Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and
could not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.
I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration
the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.

I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I
spent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at
work this month anyway.

I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet
BJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:

1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon
2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference
3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.

The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the
BJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.

As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anything
big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I
know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with
the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one
comes from - Microsoft?)

Hope this helps.

Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-))
I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better,
but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at
least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in
other ""new"" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently
available..

I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me
Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one
with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in
printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better..

===========================================================================

When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.
We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling
qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print
quality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end
up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are
using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out
of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by HP.

===========================================================================

Whenever I buy anything I look at what the ""experts"" say, pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've been
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a
few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.

I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I
bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build
a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I
tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the
result.

I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still
readily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my
views/experience:

	1.	I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away
		from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with
		the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.

	2.	I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the
		ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes
		they have the expertise.

	3.	The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly
		acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
		Windows.

	4.	I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured
		typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)
		and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is
		pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...

	5.	The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.

	6.	If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty
		slow with it, God knows what it's like without!

I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily
use.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and
having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.

Hope this is of use.

Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with
$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the
DeskJet in print quality.

Speed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).
         I don't print long docs, though.

Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is
         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up
         close; you can see a lot more ""jaggies"" than on a LaserJet.
         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
         page/print head in place, I would imagine.

Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...
         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.

Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print
         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.

Know nothing of add-on costs.

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.  The
BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare
it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (
depending on the kind of paper).  I don't have problems with the ink not
being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since
Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.

Wow, it's funny you should ask this.  I'm a little behind in news reading
so I know this may be late.

  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried
that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is
fantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless you
get 2 inches from the page.

  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it
under Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to
install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.

  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut
I felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won't
say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.  Just my
$0.02 worth.

Subject: Question on EISA video board performance
Keywords: EISA, video, performance
Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 25

I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most
EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA
counterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is
only about as ""fast"" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't
what I would call ""fast.""

I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the
same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits.

Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher
cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than
and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a
Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report,
I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's
around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow
me to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still
have $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother-
board too...)

Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?

Thanks!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com

Yep, you can use any type of UNIX, or maybe VMS, or buy a MAC or something...
  If you want longer filenames for your documents, I heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files. Those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs open/save dialogs though... Maybe someone knows more about
this wordprocessor than I do?

Sounds like a memory conflict problem, which can cause truly weird symptoms 
like these. Call Dell tech support (or better, post to them on CSERVE if you
have an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video RAM on your
machine. The block windows from using those ranges with an
EMMEXCLUDE= statement in the 386Enh section of SYSTEM.INI. You probably
should include a statement excluding the same range from EMM386 or whatever
memory manager you use in CONFIG.SYS.

Dell ""installs"" Windows on the machines they ship, but the installation doesn't
consist of much more than  copying the files to a hard disk. You still have
to do the work. And the fact that you have the problem in Enhanced
mode but not standard strongly suggests a high memory conflict.

You CAN print to a file from an HP (or any other printer).  Just go into
the Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want
to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the
port to connect the printer to.

When you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout.

It's pretty easy.

Good luck!

Dos 5 never used the area $E000 - $EFFF, as well as some others. If you have

   Anyone know of a good software package that will allow us to keep track of
who is printing what and when?  Is there any way to get Print Manager to keep
a log?  Is there a Print Manager replacement that will do this?  How about a
package that will only allow access to the system for people in a password 
file?  I looked at Chastity, but it will let you log in without a password,
and doesn't keep tabs of who got on and when.  
   Any help will be greatly appreciated.

This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago. My HD was stacked
with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of
the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names). In other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos6 that is troublesome. 

I now use Stacker v 3.0, and so far I have had no trouble.

Subject: Windows NT: Help needed with IO error 0x0069
Organization: TUBerlin/ZRZ
Lines: 33

Hi everybody out there,
I just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of WindowsNT
and still am not able to boot up that system. The final step
achieved is the display of IO-error 0x0069. But, since this is
the beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT, Microsoft does
not include a manual on the OS itself, explaining what this
error means of what I can do to get rid of. My configuration
is: 
Mainboard     Hauppauge 4860-25, rev. A7 (a 486 with socket for i860)
              28megs of memory (512k*36,1M*36,2M*36)
AMI EISA SCSI controller (15series), latest bios, 16MB cache 
              ST41200N hard disk
              Syquest 555 removable disk
              Toshiba 3301 CD ROM drive
ProAudio Spectrum Plus 16
Longshine Ethernet card LCS8634 (NE2000 comp.)
ET4000 graphics card, 1Meg (ColorImage5)
The system is running fine under DOS and Windows 3.1 etc, but
trying to do the setup for NT,
- automatic setup does not recognize controller (AHA1542-compat.)
  when adding manually, NT complains not finging any CD-ROM drive
- the manual setup (WINNT) does not copy everything from CD to HD,
  does not recognize controller, but takes it manually.
  Setup continues until it tries to boot. Then it starts loading
  several stuff from disk (seems to fing the HD), but messing up
  with that damned IO-Error 69.
I took away all IO cards not essential, but that did not make any
effect.
Anybody got any ideas? Help would be greatly appreciated.

Here is another hint:

	I have a really jumping mouse (ps2 type), and finally the mouse
stops jump changing HIMEM.SYS (yes, himem!), is you use:

DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS /M:x

x can be 1,2,...,8 (Of course my computer DON'T appear on the list for

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS
6.  A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  The point out
that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a
number of folks problems.

MS's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).

Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  I want to see
the MS spin doctors explain this.

This pretty much confirms my original impression after reading
through the documentation on dos-6.  The double space sounds nice,
but NOT on your primary disk!!  I'll probably wind up making a
disk partition d: and doublespacing *it*, using it as an archive.
Probably would be useful on floppy disks as well.  But on c:?  Uh, uh...

[I particularly disliked the note that said something like ""double
space is irreversible""].

How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie?  Are
there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows
to not want to give you enhanced mode?

 I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad.  AT any case, a lot
of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to
.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
(shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think,
where VVV is the ver. number.  If that's not true, let me know and I""ll
post a corection).


This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you
have to rename it.

NOW, another thing....
this is from the windows' FAQ:

your file has to be less than 64 K
( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than
about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know).

Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size
is.)  If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a
way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,
such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure about
this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the
filename). 

ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.

These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory.

Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your
new win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from a
directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of
the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.


Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).

Well, I got  WINZIP from cica (don't know which version, but I think
it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and I was initially imressed.
But here's the low-down:

WINZIP is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  It lets you
vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a
/checkout directory, and creates a ""checkout"" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program.

*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don't
konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I
""zip"" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
or other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit
all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know
(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,
now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the ""run"" cmd)
but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zip
file, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.

Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful ""unzip""ing
functions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the new
ver.  (as for now, a good old, ""run-->unzip *.zip"" will work.

(PS> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).

peace,
Mickey

Speaking of that.....
My comp has ""emmexclude=$e000-$efff"" or something of that nature in the
system.ini file.  Or some system file for *windows*.

I was just wondering if having that line in a *windows* startup file is
better, as it will give some more memory on dos apps., but disable it
when you run windows?

(Actually, I *do* think that that line is also in the system.1 file)

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the
shareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two.  You can download
it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try
scanning the index files).

To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a
""Save as...""  Select ""Windows bitmap"" and ""Compressed"" (or is it ""RLE""?)
Whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...

Sorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb
terminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!

Please Help if you can. Whenever I try to run windows useing the 16
million color mode with the drivers supplyed with my Diamond Stelth 24x
It will lock up requireing a full system reset to break out. The drivers
that I have for windows are V.1.00 for windows 3.1 (which IS the version
of windows I am useing)

My Setup
---------
386DX40 128KCach
4 Megs of ram
14"" SVGA touch Monitor non-interlaced
AMI Bios

Any and all help would be apreciated, The card seems to work fine in other
modes, I usually run windows in 800x600 mode and probs at all, so I am
hopeing it is a driver and not a card problem.

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41


    This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help.

    I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.

    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many
    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT
    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when
    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under
    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than
    my shell running.

    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.  

    1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are
    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at
    plugging this leak?

    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?

    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.

    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was
    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different
    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources?

    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically?

    Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email.

Subject: Local Windows .vs. Shared Windows (Discussion)
Organization: The Ohio State University, Department of Physics
Lines: 110

I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a Novell administrator's point of view.
 
I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they
(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,
the LOCAL setup (described below) as the ""most advantageous installation"".
If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.
 
The LOCAL Windows Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the
resources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,
he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.
Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all drivers
are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.
 
Advantages:
- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to
  the local access of main Windows files.
- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point
  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing
  and reduce the cost of down-time.
- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard
  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network
  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster
  access than local ones.
- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the
  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.
 
Disadvantages:
- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.
- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to
administer.
  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of
  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.
- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for
  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.
- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup
  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.
  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be
  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
  applications and *not* user data.
 
The SHARED Windows Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure
described above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of
files to individual ""user"" directories.  These directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network ""home"" directory.  The bulk of the
Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout
their Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These include
group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.
 
Advantages:
- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As
  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this
  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.
- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,
  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct
  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.
- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files
  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with
  all driver updates.
 
Disadvantages:
- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network
  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
  speed of Windows.
- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's
  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs
  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will
  usually not be able to save their work.
- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files
  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a
  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows
  files alone.
- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being
  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).
  
The Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows
userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I have
setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money.
 
I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Should
apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how
Windows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is ""putting all eggs in one basket"";
if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.
 
Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to
hear from people with ""actual"" working experience with users and network
administration.

a shell (it DOES call DOS ), but a very, very good one. It will also
do arc, arj and lzh. It fully supports PKZIP 2.04 . Try using it...
It might be a shell --very unobtrusive--, but that also means you dont
need to update it with every every-other-letter-of-the-alphabet version

Subject: TCP/IP through Windows 3.1
Lines: 52

I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question:

CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the
         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my
         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it
         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone
         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that
         I type ""telnet uicvm"" or ""tn3270 uicvm"" (either will work) at the DOS
         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then
         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon
         screen. ""TELNET"" and ""TN3270"" are the names of batch files in my SLIP
         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the
         session.

PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I
         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I
         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that
         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me
         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to
         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)
         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP
         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP
         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-
         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when
         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often
         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center
         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to
         them with more questions.

QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows
         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too
         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that
         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost
         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:

         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1
         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation
         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the
            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp
            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about
            that.

         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true
         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under
         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently
         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet
         session and other applications.

Any information received is appreciated.

Yes Russ, there is. 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version.

Last I looked QuinZip could be found on the Monash University (Australia)
mirror site of Cica, so I'd assume it's still on Cica itself
and other mirrors.

Have a look in the /util(s?) directory for a file called
qzip21.zip.

Subject: Observation:  Floppy copy works under PGM MGR, but not DOS shell.
Organization: Motorola (Austin,TX)
Lines: 51
NNTP-Posting-Host: ome.sps.mot.com

Has anyone observed this?  If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP
file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5"") under MS Windows 3.1 via either
Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell 
has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not.

The corruption is detected by executing ""pkunzip -t b:\file.zip"" after 
both copies.  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption.


Now here's the kicker:


I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps.
Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the 
DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).


So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running,
and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive).  Under this 
scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the Windows
apps and one slice for the running DOS app.  

When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks
are essentially inactive.  Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and
95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices.  Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = 
.72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. 

When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell
(no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task
manager.  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice
(assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: 
(1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time.

So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU
time?  Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy 
copy?  It must be!

Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane!

I have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears
to be memory-related.  It's actually not limited to windows, but
that's where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine's 486DX33,
8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard.

1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower than
on my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow,
applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear.
(Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things that
appear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes the
system etc..)

2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other
programs)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast as
I've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics than
when I don't run BC beforehand.

3)  I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys.  Installing
emm386.exe does not fix the problem- it makes it worse.  After emm386 is
installed, running BC will not fix the problem anymore.

This problem is driving me nuts.  If you think you can help,
please reply through the mail.
Thanks,
Evan

Do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp. DOS window?

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  I'm afraid 
I don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.

It's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.

I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A.  Turned off
smartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc.  This same disk aborts
Norton Speed Disk (NU 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting NDD to be
run when attempting to defrag drive.  At Some peoples' suggestion
I reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 5.0, Win 3.1 from
scratch.  A few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1
beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, So I tried this
drastic solution.  When the problem reoccurred, I didn't have the
brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.

I get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro.
when I get the message, I run file manager and copy the
offeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp.  Then I quit
and restart windows(If the group is an often used important one.)

This really sucks.  But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the
drive (especially with the NSD problem).  I will be going with
out over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while
the guy I bought the disk and system from, goes over it and
either fixes it or replaces the drive.  I can't wait to have a
system that will run consistently with all hte goodies!

It's the applications that do this.  Unfortunately, even the applets

Solitaire, for example).

None that I know of.  If an application doesn't give back the

Windows.

If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them
don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it.

No.  This is a problem with the applications, usually.

There are books written on this one.  In general, just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit.  Unfortunately, I
understand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so
there's no way to avoid this entirely.

There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages
to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on
the resource pool.

You bet your bippy it's built like a tank.. and not just mechanically either!

This past weekend we had a nasty thunderstorm and the impossible (*&^%)
happened - I got a direct lightning strike on my house - and to the second
floor outlet box into which my faithful DeskJet 500C was connected. There
was a .303-bullet-sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified
aluminum slag dripping from it. You could actually see the electrical box
through the hole! The outlet itself was fried and I'm still amazed the
whole damn house didn't burn down.

I lost 2 electric garage door openers,  2 vcr's, 2 telephones (all of which
were on the opposite side of the house), a ZyXEL U-1496E high speed modem,
a VGA monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the RS232 and parallel ports on my
X terminal and a WD LAN card in my PC. Not a good night!

But, the DeskJet ran as soon as I found a functioning serial and parallel
port to connect to it.

    Hi,
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's ""Plug-in"" for Program Manager.
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN13.  Its an add-on which gives
      some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better
      manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,
      constant status of RAM and resources, ""Quick-menu"" (a drop-down
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher), plus some other neat stuff.
      Used it, liked it, and even reg'd it <G>.

      If you can't find it anywhere, let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you (shareware version, of course <g>...)

Aloha...

Please do not do this!

I don't know how the rest of you read news, but here's how I do it:  I
subscribe to an ""outernet"" system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download e-mail and news articles automatically.  When someone posts a
huge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.  I also pay for
the connect time, which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K
modem and each day's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so. 
Today's session, however, lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP. 
Consequently, it cost me about $3.00 extra just to receive a file that I
didn't want in the first place.

If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available, there are other
ways to do it:  either upload the file to an ftp site (like
ftp.cica.indiana.edu, which has a complete Windows section) and tell
people how to get to it, or use one of the newsgroups like
alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that), which are file archives
rather than discussion groups.  Don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files, especially when they're 600K in size.

The sensitivity is changed using the /S, /V, or /H parameter.

Follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).
The default is 50.  You can type the command ""mouse /S75"" right from the

Does this need to have anything to do with disk compression? I have 
experienced the same thing a couple of times myself, but *without* any disk 
compression stuff installed. (For example, guess what happened when Norton 
SpeedDisk once crashed during defragmenting!)

Good question.
Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?)
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.
        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.
        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but
        they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.
        So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at
        33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on
        a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as
        fast as ISA.

That's a very good question.  The EISA bus does have more advantages
over the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better 
interrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact
 a video card very much.  They have more impact on file servers with 
multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.

Hi,

	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988

It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386

trying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.

I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 
Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.

First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  
are.

What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  
IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  
be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there?

Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  
got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  
why I should load this driver?

Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.

Keep the swap file on the IDE.  32-bit access is worth a fair amount more

emm386 noems enables the system to use the ""upper memory"" between 640 and

Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
config.sys  If you are using W4WW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space.  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys.  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives.  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).

I'd like to substitute the exciting win3.1 opening logo for our own
company logo at boot up time. Is this a matter of replacing the logo
file with our own logo? And what format should the company logo be
in? Thanks.

Development of what?  In-house apps?  Maybe, but  certainly not apps
to be sold on an open market.  Statistics like that are laughable,
because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrink-wrapped
usable apps for UNIX and they have to be developed disproportionately
often as compared to the installed UNIX base.

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing
what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright
and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to
be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,
marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all
that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since
they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the
Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over
antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who
have a great idea, yet get it ""borrowed"" by larger corporations who
can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from
the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

     I know that I've seen this question asked before, but I don't remember
seeing any answers..So here it is again:

     Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside?
I've checked cica, and I'm sure it's not there (I'm refering to the new
version of the driver that came out in 2(?)/93).  I have seen it on c-serve,
but I hesitate to d/l 1 meg. at 2400 bps unless I really have to!
     Alternativly, is it possible to get Paradise (or WD) to mail me the new
drivers, or don't they do that.

     Finally, is it even worth the hassle of getting these things, or is
there not much improvement over my 10/92 version?

                             Thanks for the info,

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create. I've found that putting a line in system.ini in the
ports section with just a path and filename works. The only problem is that
if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.

Lets see... what MS products don't have major bugs in them?  Oh, but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their
customers must buy new ""releases"" from them that are little more than
bug fixes.  Anyone who buys a $2500 computer system and then runs MS
Windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.  

Oh wait! MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mouse---didn't
they?  ""Logitech Inside""

You can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to
neophytes.  If MS does anything, it appears someone has to do it
first.  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.

I've been using Windows NT (tm) since the October release, and I have to 
say that the March release is really a big improvement.  Windows NT (tm)
is becomming usable.

There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.
First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.
What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other
resourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  
And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone
knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), 
please let me know.

The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.
For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster
(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't 
produced drivers yet.

Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and
give the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever
you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into
Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.

Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows
though.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should
really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work
well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never
heard of anyone else who did either.

It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the
box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.

I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint
of heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.

I have a copy.  It isn't in there.  Microsoft says it will not be in

Take a look at WinQVT/net -- the latest version is QVT/net 3.4
It comes in versions that are direct to packet driver, as well as a PC NFS 
version.

It is priced quite low; registration = $40, student registration = $20, and is 
a nice package -- comes complete with VT220 terminal emulation, FTP, POP3 
client, LPR, and NNTP client.

You can FTP it from ""biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu"" /pub/qvtnet/qvtnet34.zip

It was also uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu recently.

The problem is that QuinZip is very very slow.  So I think that WinZip 4.0

COM files are limited to a total size of 64KB.  Thus, win.cfn plus vgalogo.log 
plus your RLE file must be less than 64KB.  Thus, your RLE file should be 
around 30KB.

Note that the two tables don't talk about the same population.  One is
Fortune 1000 companies favoring the platform as their primary
application platform, the other is sales (to everyone, not just
Fortune 1000).  Fortune 1000 companies don't do a lot of development
with the Mac as their top platform.  I would expect that that would
explain the discrepancy.

I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA
board.  Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I
would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  

So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
not.

Well, I thought that highmem.sys would do that too. I just took out emm386  
of my config.sys, and I'm still loading my other drivers high (mouse, vga  
shadow bios, dos-key etc.) I haven't checked mem/c, but I believe I have  
managed to load them high (ie between 640KB and 1024KB).

Also, ever since I took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, I get  
about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows (I'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
Meg RAM, 7 Meg swap) and I got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  
(before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting  
windows). 

I would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. Anybody else have  
info on this???

If it's any consolation, I had a similar problem. As I recall, if I exited
from a DOS session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a
scrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). It only
started happening after I used IconTitleFaceName in WIN.INI to change the
desktop font to Arial. So I stopped exiting from DOS sessions while in
full-screen mode.

My Mac used to do something similar. Aren't computers weird?

Generally, the second or third major release usually takes care of it.
My advice, based on plenty of personal experience, is to never buy the
first version of anything from Microsoft.  This includes major version
number upgrades from previous releases, such as Microsoft C 6.00.
Always wait at least for the ""a"" upgrade or slipstream upgrade if
you're going to buy it.

There was a post about something similar a while back.  It seems windows
does *not* take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an
applllication is using when that application is done.  That job is left
entirely to the application.  that is, the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits.

Anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will
clean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip???).

Subject: Print to file: how do I print the file later?
Organization: Mathematics Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland

Here's the situation:

At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, I
have windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, I
configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use
the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,
which I then bring to work.

My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the print
manager at work? If, for example, I select print from the file
manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish.

I know that I can open a DOS window and do:

	 copy file.ps com1:

which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.

There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the Print
Manager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in the
documentation.

Anyone know how to do this?

EMM386 is NOT reqired to load the DOS kernal high (or else you couldn't
do it on a 286).  In a mail message I recommended that he remove it
since he only runs ProcomPlus frequently in DOS, and I suspect
EMM386 will slow down windows.

It depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that
comes standard with windows, or with an icon from some other icon manager.

Well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the 
item by clicking once on it, click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'.
You should see a box which says 'Change icon'. Click on it. You are going
to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). If you don't like
any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file
'moricons.dll' Select it. Browse through the icons presented, and just
double click on your desired icon.

If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager,
say iconPower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your
screen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace.
When you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding
the mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change.
And thats it!

Danny...

While working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources,
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug
kernel. Once you have all the SDK stuff installed, (this also comes with
VC++), you run 'n2d' which does a 'normal-to-debug' swap. The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower, but you then execute the command
DBWIN, and let it report to you what is going on. You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to, and possibly about other
peoples Apps (is that OPA?..I'm sorry). 

If this doesn't make sense, repost, or e-mail me

It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources.  For example,
open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources
with ndw 2.x as shell,
 
then do the same with program manager, and see if it's the shell or the
apps.

One workstation in a WfW network goes deaf to any form of communication from

The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machine

Please don't post uuencoded bitmaps here.  If you want to do so, put them
in the alt.binaries.* areas.  These files are very large and may crash
some users newsfeeds.  It's also a waste of band width.  Also, we all
know how to convert .gif to .bmp with many programs so it'd really not
worth posting all of these .bmp files.

Subject:        Help Needed w/ DOS Apps and Windows
Lines: 21

Since loading Windows, two of my DOS applications have been
acting strangely.  It appears that font changes and page
orientation changes (so far) are not being recognized in
WordPerfect/DOS and QuattroPro/DOS.  Another DOS application
does accept font and page orientation changes, so I don't
think the problem is with the printer.

I reloaded QuattroPro, and these changes are still not
accepted whether launching from Windows or the DOS prompt.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to
correct this problem?  I've ordered QuattroPro for Windows,
but need a landscape application printed immediately.  Please e-mail.

Thanks in advance!

You must of read too many OS/2 advertisements.  ""Crash Protection"" is such
a marketing gimick, it isn't funny..  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my 
new machine I've only had it crash ONCE, and I don't have a ""run of the mill""

Microsoft is not a leader in innovation, but they certainly know how to

Hello Cliff 

Many people on the internet (like us) have to pay for
every byte of data passed through subscribed news groups.

Bitmaps are large. Bitmaps cost us a lot of money. There are
special news-groups for bitmaps because of this. We don't
subscribe to them. Put you bitmaps in the right place.
Read one of the FAQ guides in the newuser groups and it
will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of
establishments like mine that you have just cost money.

Some of them have very limited budgets.

Go away.

P.S. This is a flame ;-)

Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows.  PC
Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group
does its development under OS/2.  Another trade rag did an article
recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations
with SoftPC to test out their work.  SCO Unix is and has been a
reasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2
apps.  DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
development work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.

It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on
all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception)
.  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,
then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of 
choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the
key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it
would be more of an even fight.

Wow, what did you use it for?  Single-tasked word processing?
I have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-MB virtual machine (12MB of
RAM). My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a
floppy in the background.  Many unix people love OS/2 because they are
used to multi-tasking systems.

    OVERVIEW

    The DIB image file format is intended to be a ""Device Independent  Bitmap""
    file  format.  (What Microsoft means by ""Device Independent"" is unclear to
    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit
    pixels.

    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.
    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-
    swap all short and long integer values.

    By convention, DIB images end in the extension "".BMP"".   This  is  because

    they  are  a  super-set of earlier ""bitmap image files"".  Consequently you
    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as ""BMP"" files.

    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three ""flavors""  of  DIB
    images:
	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the
	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for
	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.
	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor
	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.
	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS

    The DOS DIB images consist of:
	 1.  A ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file	 as  a
	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image
	     file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPINFOHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,
	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows
	     RGBQUAD structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:
	 1.  The same ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file
	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the
	     image file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPCOREHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this
	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a
	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:
	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header
	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.
	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of
	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a
	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header
	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).
	 3.  The image data itself.


    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.

    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.
    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header
    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  ""windows.h""	include	 file.
    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit
    images.  The five general steps are:
	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     structures the basic image information.
	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the
	     color palette of RGBQUADS.
	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 4 -


	     the ""bfSize"" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the
	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  ""bfOffBits""	field  of  the
	     BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER,
	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).

    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-
    defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those
    not familiar with MicroSoft C.

    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {
		 WORD	 bfType;
		 DWORD	 bfSize;
		 WORD	 bfReserved1;
		 WORD	 bfReserved2;
		 DWORD	 bfOffBits;
	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;

    The ""bfType"" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves
    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered
    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the
    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.

    The ""bfSize"" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this
    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the
    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be
    calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in
    later.

    Both the ""bfReserved1"" and the ""bfReserved2""  fields  are  always  set  to
    zero.

    The ""bfOffBits"" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set
    to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written
    write after the color palette if one exists.


















			      March 15, 1991





				    - 6 -


    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{
		 DWORD	 biSize;
		 DWORD	 biWidth;
		 DWORD	 biHeight;
		 WORD	 biPlanes;
		 WORD	 biBitCount;
		 DWORD	 biCompression;
		 DWORD	 biSizeImage;
		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biClrUsed;
		 DWORD	 biClrImportant;
	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;

    The ""biSize"" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure
    itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to
    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a
    BITMAPCOREHEADER.

    The ""biWidth"" field is the width of the image in image pixels.

    The ""biHeight"" field is the height of the image in image lines.

    The ""biPlanes"" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out
    as if there was one color plane.

    The ""biBitCount"" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either
    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.

    The ""biCompression"" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
    compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.
    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how
    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the
    data is not compressed.

    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to
    zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.

    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be ""biClrUsed"".
    For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  ""biClrUsed""
    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may
    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set
    this field to zero.



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 7 -


    COLOR PALETTES

    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD
    structure is defined in the ""windows.h"" include file as:
	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {
		 BYTE	 rgbBlue;
		 BYTE	 rgbGreen;
		 BYTE	 rgbRed;
		 BYTE	 rgbReserved;
	 } RGBQUAD;
    The ""rgbReserved"" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount
    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is
    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  ""rgbBlue"",  ""rgbGreen"",  or
    ""rgbRed""   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these
    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
    composition.



    IMAGE DATA

    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image
    file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and
    certainly was.

    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel
    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The
    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:

	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.
	Windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by
	an errant application (My personal favorite?  Any one of the Corel
	3.0 programs).  On the other hand, I have had OS/2 crash randomly
	a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.

	For instance.  Today I discovered a new one.  While I was downloading
	with Procomm Plus For Windows (running seamless with the standard
	VGA drivers on a run-o' da mill VGA card--640x480), I decided that
	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my 
	.finger.  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless, 
	I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session.  Whoops, the download
	finished while WinOS/2 was loading.  It had _just_ gotten
	the pointer up, so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop
	(I have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).
	
	Blam.  Screen trashed, Procomm hangs up.  Hm.  Well, I can sorta
	see the mouse, so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session 
	and got back my fullscreen Windows session (but the color were
	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).
	So I closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).

	PP+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer 
	""connected"" to the com port--so I exited it (the normal way--
	it told me I was still online and it would hang up, though it
	was _already_ hung up).  Hm.  Well, load anothe--no, bad idea. 
	Shutdown and reboot.

	Ok, refresh first.. Now, shutdown.  Yes, everything is closed...

	Hm.  Nothing seems to be happening.  Let's see.. Ah, the 
	windows list still comes up.  OK, let's try shutdown again.

	No go.  Huh.

	Alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.

	Hmm.  Still seems to be running OS/2.  Try shutdown again.
	Nothing.  Oh well.  Reboot.  Enjoy the checkdisk time.
  
	In this case, a part of the OS crashed not only itself, but
	OS/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s
	been compromised, I guess).  In everyday (specifically _today_)
	use.


> OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or

	That's the idea, anyway.  In truth, when a program crashes on 
	OS/2, it will bring the system down with it.  The programs that
	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2, but programs
	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt,
	task protection or no.  

	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP 5.1 (DOS) locks up my system.  It works fine under DOS or even in
	a dos box under Windows 3.1.  (Admittedly, it doesn't crash if I run
	WP51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).

	Please explain.  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even
	then, not long--I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing 
	this--I've downloaded with PP+ @9600 while printing).



> and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS,


	Not sure what you mean here.  OS/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six
	of these for it's own use (more if you want to count WinOS/2). 
	Windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the
	disk cache as I am for OS/2) for itself.  If memory efficiency 
	were a big issue, PC GEOS would be the current king of the 
	Intel desktop.

	On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence
	that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
	them.  For instance, the machine I am sitting at runs both fine, 
	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows. 
	(But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash 
	install).  On the whole, I'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive
	than Windows, but there are (I suppose) machines that Windows
	just doesn't like.

       33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA
When:  Wednesday, May 5th
       7 pm to 9 pm
			 
			 
NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,
only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue
of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a ""Hot Prospect"". Now, NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to
the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and
Motorola hardware.

NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression
486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo
in San Francisco.

The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  
interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!

The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft.
Call their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy)
and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec.

Warning:  It is not terribly useful, and you will need to do a *lot* of
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored.

General primer:

Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks.  The first chunk is the
actual text in the file.  This is all stored together and has nothing
but text and graphics.  The second chunk is the formatting information.

For general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes
of the file (its a general header).  Then read the remaining text until you
hit binary data.

I assumed he was referring to OS/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while DOS
(and therefore Windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  As a programmer, I
agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  It's annoying, too.
But when just a Windows user, I don't think about it much.  And, I doubt many
other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,
calcing a spreadsheet, etc...It works and they get their work done.

Just a neutral comment:
It's funny, I think, how arguments about Windows vs OS/2 sound so very
similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that.
It's somehow very personal to people.  Convictions are irrational and
there's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.

I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have
absolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a ""random"" crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  don't  remember
_ever_ crashing.

Of course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running
Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from
particularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write
buffer, everything would work fine.

FTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies
(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)

>	For instance, I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed

Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that
under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background.

>> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS,

>	Not sure what you mean here.

The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around
720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see
around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for
my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now
handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course,
the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply
_never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows,
so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....

I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript 
laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might 
not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 
2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a 
rather important font :-) 

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the 
[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't 
work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file 
everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with. 

And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. 

Has anyone encountered problems like this? 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?

I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats

 MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change 
 from DOS 5.0.  It's been dropped, along with BACKUP, JOIN, EDLIN  
 and a couple other crummy old DOS commands.  You can still use the
 5.0 commands if you absolutely have to, but they are not included
 on the 6.0 distribution disks.

 However, in MIRROR's case, I'm 99.9% certain that it does not know
 anything about DoubleSpaced drives...

several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd
mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and
perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS
apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live
without it.

	Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working
with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals
are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that
leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be
Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself.

	As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've
read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.

	Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often.

	Thanks for any replies.

The number you gave is the Borland BBS, and darned if I can find any
stealth drivers there!

Diamond's BBS is 1-408-730-1100 - according to the manual I got with

You have one. Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it. You need to associate file extensions with such things as the
notepad for it to do this though.

This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you
drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file
(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.

Yes it invokes the associated application. That takes but 10 seconds?

Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 16

I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute
a DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File
Manager. A message box comes up and says ""This program or one of its
components is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the
file.""

Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program
from DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM
(yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells
me that the file is already expanded.

All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying
to execute a DOS program from Windows.

Clues anyone?  Thanks!!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com

Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 32


I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as
a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as ""foo.txt ."" I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
""foo.txt"" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems.

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move ""foo.txt"" to a specified directory, rename it using
the current date and time, and delete the original ""foo.txt .""

In other words, ""foo.txt"" gets renamed as ""5012300"", say, on May 1
at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and
""foo.txt"" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec
macro points to it.

My main question is this: 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
time/date variable in the new filename?

The May issue of PC/Computing page 246 has a Windows hint and tips for
just this thing.  You have to edit the WIN.INI file and add a couple
of lines.  I tried it and it works.  I actually made my Title bar
and iconized text, and icon text smaller.  On my monitor it works well.
You can select a larger font also.  You edit the WIN.INI file with
a font name in your system directory.  Read the article because I would
not want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your
system problems.

  Well, I've come into some money and want to buy CD-ROM, sound board

as I think I want to spend on a board (~$120), and I've looked at the
Gravis Sound board, which is about $140 and I don't know the
adv/disadv of either of these boards.  

  Right now I want to use it with any games that support sound, and to
use in Windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  So any
concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would
be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else is interested in this info I
would be glad to summarize responses and post.  

  And if this is some type of FAQ please point me in the right

Make sure you use the small fonts driver & not the large fonts driver. Check

Its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and ""stable"" in
general than serial mice.  If I remember correctly, its because
of the differences in how the interrupts are handled, as well as
the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus
as opposed to a (9600 bps?) serial connection.

Windows prefers extendend memory instead of expanded (more work to do for Win)

I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows.
Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:

1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?

As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get
around the above problem, I am working on the following approach:

I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load
this template of mine, which will work in the following way:

It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
.INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file.

1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way
to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?

2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time?

I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  A

Artist and Hijaak for Windows.  Anyone have any experience with those or
some others?  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and
I'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^(
 
I'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rode
it on.  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving
me crazy.  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a
TIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left
and right sides of the picture [!].  Usually it confines itself to not
copying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for
editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.
 
The one nice thing it has, though, is it's ""dither"" option.  You'd think
that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,
256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W,
you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which
turn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on
buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the
3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.
 
If you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less

I received my Graphite VL on Thursday, and I've had a little bit of 
experience with it now.  In general, it feels *FAST*, although this
is the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are 
impressive.

With my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I've had the following
WinTach 1.0 results:


Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATI Graphics Ultra		13.5	14.5	19.1	25.0	18.0
ATI Ultra+ (no aperture)	11.2	13.8	10.7	20.9	14.1
Hercules Graphite VL		16.1	67.8	41.4	52.8	44.5

Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB
had an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as
fast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.

As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-
redraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2
seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson's
contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex
Micrografx Draw document.

So far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.
The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  And
I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules'
software developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).  Call 800-532-0600 if you want to
give it a try -- I'm a happy customer now!

	Yesterday, a friend of mine got a new driver for his card that more

driver? Wouldn't that be _horrible_ ? :) So netlanders, I need samples of
your collective experience (sic) -- Do you proud owners of a Trident 8900C
video card w/ 1MB VRAM have tried out more than one driver fro MS Win 3.1
which? which is the fastest? Not to be selfish, and to give you a motive
for responding, I promise I am going to collect all the answers, and the
actual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)
get the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and... post the results here...
I am interested in SVGA drivers only (plain VGA users should run the Win
driver, or this is what I 've heard -- dont flame me!) Particularly
800x600x16 and/or 800x600x256 (that should cover the majority of SVGA users)
Well, what are you waiting for? hit that r or f or whatever...

But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree - it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
some files!  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car.

Only because its crap, which is noones fault but their own.

By deliberately crippling the product?  Surely no...

Oh, hold on, I guess you're right.  That certainly stinks of MicroSoft
marketing techniques.

But the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new
technology, and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long
before Windows was even dreamt of.

Well Amen to that, but I wish it were a damn sight deader.  For a dead
product, its used an awful lot.  And I suspect its going to carry on
twitching for a long while yet, which isn't doing anyone any good.

(And MicroSoft don't appear to have given up marketing DOS, so it is a very
unusual form of death indeed).

We all had that problem, you need to expand the fonts manually, the program

Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts
is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is
gorgeous.
Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode
features of TT fonts (in Windows NT).

I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts;
I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite
inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts).
Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first
looks better.

I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !

--> FTP

     COSY_PAK is available by anonymous `ftp' from 
mishna.esys.cwru.edu (Internet No. 129.22.40.23). A sample ftp session 
is given at the end of this file.

**********************************************************************

--> Changes in Version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)

	In this version, we have revised COSY_PAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v2.1.  
Since Mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. This has made COSY_PAK 
smaller. Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSY_PAK v0.81 are no longer needed directly by COSY_PAK v0.9. For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing (available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  IP # 130.207.226.24).  On  
the  downside, the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version. 


***********************************************************************	
--> For Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in  
the directory `For_2.0'. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 

**************************************************************************
	    
--> Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSY_PAK - a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica 2.1. Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT (TM) computer (a UNIX based workstation). They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts (Ogata [1991], Phillips and Harbor [1991]) for 
undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU. In addition to the NeXT, they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers (TM), and, 
IBM PC's (TM) running MS Windows(TM). We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.

    Once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks (""COSY_Notes"") which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages. The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine, standard, undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references. Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file. The contents of the notebooks in the ""COSY_Notes"" directory are

--> Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSY_PAK v0.9
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are:

 COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSY_PAK_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex 4.0 
				format (requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
	
 COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MS-DOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh / IBM PC / Unix systems also.


--> Installation of COSY_PAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command:

      zcat COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z | tar xvf -

 o In Macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command:

      pkunzip -o -d COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip

NOTE: This .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. You must use 
pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight. In that event type ""pkunzip -o -d 
COSY_PAK.zip.  You can also unzip the COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.


     Uncompressing and untarring ""COSY_PAK_09.tar.Z"" or unzipping 
""COSY_PAK_IBM_09.zip"" will create a directory called ""COSY_PAK"".

        c:\winmath\packages                  	on an IBM PC.

	At the beginning of the ""Initialization"" cell of each notebook 
in  ""COSY_Notes"" directory, we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory:

	(* Initialization of Path *)

	(* Example For a UNIX machine  (Default) *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""/LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For an Apple Macintosh  *) 
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,
	{""MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages""}];
	*)
	
	(* Example For IBM PC 	
	 *)
	(*
	$Path=Join[$Path,	
	 {""c:\winmath\packages""}];	
	*)	

Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
Mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$Path' 
setting.

	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory

        /LocalLibrary/Mathematica/Packages     	on a UNIX machine
        MY_HardDisk:Mathematica:Packages   	on a Apple Macintosh
        c:\winmath\packages                	on an IBM PC


--> Mathematica 2.0 users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory For_2.0. Please move all files and directory under For_2.0 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory. 


--> Getting started

       After installation, start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the ""COSY_Notes"" directory. All notebooks load their own packages. 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was

I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice
before 2.0 was released).

Hmm. Are you sure?  I'm speaking from my own experience as an
OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps).
Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).

Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to ""sell"" 
readers on our products (which would conflict with the ""no-ads"" 
philosophy of usenet).  Nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,
members of the BORG.

While the 64K limit may not be _necessary_ limitation, they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations.  If you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text, it's probably
time take a good look at your program's design.

>Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory

In what way is 8192 a 'small' number?  It seems to me that you'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles, unless, of course, you're abusing GlobalAlloc.


And _please_ don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems.  All systems have
limits.  The question is whether or not the limits are _reasonable_.  So
far, you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.

You don't, and never had to.  That's what enhanced shells are for.  Remember 
4DOS and NDOS?  I mean, come on, you can't expect DOS to cover everything 
from R1.0.  Microsoft has other projects to work on.

I don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  On the other hand, it 
IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
top of DOS.  I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC.  With 
XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna 
need a fast processor.

Except for the people who use DOS programs, which means about 75% or more of

It certainly smacks of that! Remember the ""POLL"" that you quoted saying that
you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how
unbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming
from a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.

Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very 
unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that
OS.

That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more 
defensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage
this too, IMHO.

Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for
MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing.
I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ... I have not doubts about their 
abilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices.

I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode.  
For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending

How can I remedy this?

While I do not think he is lying, I also feel hesitant to take anybody ""on their
word"" unless they can attribute a source for thier claims. With all the FUD 
and misinformations and misconceptions and outright lies flying around the 
advocacy newsgroups, I do not trust any unsubstantiated rumor or claim 
- especially from any employees of IBM's OR MicroSoft, or anyone who seems to
have a vested interest.

Hello,

I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows.
The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing,
mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem
card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk.

My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All
three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large
harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least:
Workgroups for Windows.

My questions:
- Is this possible?
- What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows?
- Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone
  is working.

Thanks,
Martijn

I'd like to get a system running OS/2 2.0 GA talking to a network of PCs
running Windows for Workgroups.  Acting as a server would be wonderful,

Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box?  Or is there a way to actually

Following up to my own article...  I found that several people say that 
LAN Server clients can talk to WFW.  Is this, then, also true for LAN
Manager?  (Don't LAN Server and LAN Manager share common roots?)

You are pervert.. Ok vi is not CUA but it has a powerful set of commands.
One for all it has 26 separate clipboard (and not only one ofor all kind of

The only problem is to Know the commands (the keyboard shortcut).
I am quite fast with the pc keyboard... and I usually use all fingers to digit

< rest deleted >

As a followup to my post let me add that:

I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.
However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the
application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from
within an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their
site-specific ""batch profile"" into a dataset within our product, specifying
the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,
etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session.

As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80
characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in
batch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a
problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.
MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single
command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is
*STANDARD* with OS/2).

The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not
within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.
Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.
And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with NT.

I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like ""Is vi
available for Windows?"") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and
***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites.

One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,
i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific
commands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment
on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Thanks again for the help,

I solved my problem.  I still do not understand why it happens ths
way; perhaps some of you C++ gurus can explain this to all of us!

For some reason when I define the following functins in the class
definition (in the .h file) the compiler thinks some pure virtual
functions are not defined.  When I placed these two in a separate
source file and compiled them, the problem went away.  Any ideas what
happen?  Are the functions that are defined in the class construct all
inline ?  Is this the problem?

virtual int            isEqual (const Object _FAR &obj) const

Hiyas ALL,

Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I 
couldn't wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. 
No part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.

	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of 
the 
systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're 
willing to 
give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their 
support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
Windows 3.1. 
	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned 
some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop 
Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

.dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 
100K the 
other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied 

with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  
to a 
directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll 
in my 
Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) 
When I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the 
applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions 

for trouble-shooting?

For the most part, this newsgroup is ""attack"" oriented.  Microsoft has been
attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the
intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  ANYONE
would get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  We are human beings as
well.  You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might
feel is unwarranted is leveled.

No, I'd rather not.  First of all, I don't have exact figures, and I don't
want to disclose how I know this.  However, I will say that Jim Francis
from Microsoft just posted a figure of $26 million (payment from IBM to
Borland) and that's somewhere in the range that I've heard.

It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it.
Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that, or...

>Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was? 

When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product, I figured it wasn't
from there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.
And I was told it was from a survey of registered users.  And I 
posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came 
from.

>That post sure looked like FUD....and coming from a microsoftie 
>.... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.

Hmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where
they came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is 
""fear, uncertainty & doubt"".)

>Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very

????  I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't 
pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other
OSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary
features.  I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in
comp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a 
new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded 
during release, unless the sales are a total bomb).

I ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really*
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?

I just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie

I had posted that it came from a survey of registered users, I 
double-checked with a friendly neighborhood marketing type and
found there were actually two surveys. One of randomly selected
resellers, one of randomly selected users from the 6 upgrade

Is there a hot-key for the Windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  If not, is
there an easy way to create one?  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly
secure).  Also, the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCK32.ZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out.

Thanks for any and all help.

Which translates to 7% not satisfied.  I don't think it's the awkward 
recursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows 
interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).

	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes.

Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises 
me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is 
less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible 
anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it?

Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the 
doublespace!

Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?

Hello,

recently I noticed there is a directory named ""DiskImage"" in my disk.  I didn't
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files.
I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of
the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space.  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

Thanks,

Organization: Performance Systems Int'l
X-Mailer: PSILink-DOS (3.3)
Lines: 65

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice.

First a general description of the machine as follows:
 Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache
      (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it)
 Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256)
 ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board
 primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller
 secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller
 tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller
 planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port
 Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller
  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface.
 Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board
 (ugly dos software drives the latter)

Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken
and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio
work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo,
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I use
Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she 
won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from 
Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files.  

I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the 
shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can
hope can't I, after all, I have work to do).

The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and 
hardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the 
upgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I
still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) 
from some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'm
allergic to command lines!  I plan to run a ""pure"" NT system.  Also, will 
NT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite 
Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the 
system (It's cramped now).

I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT 
version?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk
will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)
a comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask 
Chili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd
rather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without
DOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?

Any feedback or advice (including ""forget NT"" with good reasons) is much
appreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better
multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),
and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe
there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing 
about them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)

Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.

Thanks,
Nathan Gregory

Are you sure you want to do that?  If a win app locks up for some reason, 
ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows.  
Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion.
I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke.  Just a 
thought.

Aha, I think I found the problem and it isn't dirt!  Another guy here was 
using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the 
default VGA for Windows).  He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I 
loaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.  
Seems like it is the S3 driver!  Is there any newer one than version 1.4 
that would solve this problem?  It is really bad.  I have to use the 
keyboard instead sometimes!  The s3-w31.zip on cica is version 1.4 (which is 
the same version that came with my card).

I think it is important to clear up your first reply.  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   You are
correct re: caching the compressed drive.  However, as I understand it,
you can cache the uncompressed drive.  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker.  C being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the
uncompressed disk.  You should only attempt to stack D:.  In fact, with
Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your A,B and D drives.

This is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usually
are OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life.
If you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification,
usually you'll end up with Japanese (or whoever that is competitive) owing your
business - i.e. short-sighted. IMO, this is very irresponsible, narrow minded and
selfish. Henceforth, ignoring the attack is not the right approach. As a matter of
fact, I just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is the
greatest assets of this society. Sales number and stock price is the short-term
result, not the cause.

Less than 1/2 of mailorder price!

I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars
mail order.  They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just
some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!)  They are:

1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images).
   This costs a thousand bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as
   high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art,
   etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R.
   library as higher.  Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's
   are B&W.  It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion.

2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can
   purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size).
   This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as
   very high quality, but it's only B&W.

3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags).  This costs
   about 4 hundred bucks mailorder.  I rate this clip art as very high quality
   (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which).  Some of
   the images are color, but most are B&W.

For what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats.
They are readable on Mac's and PC's.  Additionally, Totem's will mount native-
NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC
filesystems.  I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned
all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago).

Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business
(and I've seen lots).  Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color
library around, although I like 3G's color art better.

I want $850 for everything.  Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as
VISA/MC charge.  If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S.
If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee.

Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.

Please research carefully.  Just because a fax modem behaves like
a printer on a ""local"" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality 
when a ""local"" machine has fax software printing to a ""remotely
installed"" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the 
fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's
peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware
interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager
program merely ""intercepts"" the print job and spools it to
it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To
software, it appears the job was ""printed"".  Print Manager 
plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.

Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be
required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.

Good luck.

If you happen to be running the new msdos 6, you could use multi-

Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures
of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think
in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.
I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.

I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
them are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't want
to GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does
this and does it WELL. We are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete
suite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business
function on a Novell network running all software off the server.
It does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
Windows again. 
Again I repeat to MS keep doing what you are doing. You are doing a great
job.

switching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse,
I've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work.
The only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works
perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional
parallel and serial port.  Could that cause the problem? 

  Thanks in advance for any help.

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good
success in duplicating unix-style file mounts.  You will hear lots of
people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command
(a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them.  You also will hear
people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.  But, in
Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:

  ""JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if
  you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for
  Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives
  from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use
  JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.""

Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.  However, I
have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems
that have been ""mounted"" using join.

In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.  It gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It
wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then
delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.

Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem, but not always).  Then, after deleting the original
*.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.  Unless you
search your disk systems, the document is gone.

I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box
when JOINed filesystems are present.  I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg
ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an ""ls"" on the c:\temp
dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.  (This is difficult to 
reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think
this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw
DOS.

So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like.

Wouldn't it be real great to ""mount"" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main
file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately,
JOIN won't let you do it.  There was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source.

It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters.  I realize that MessDos was
meant for casual, even ignorant users, so ""mounting"" all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry
this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant 
users -- NOT!).  With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.

I am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.  The sound card I have

Using Windows MediaPlayer, I can play the midi files that came with

may not play right, and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable
this message in the future.

Is this normal, or do I have something set wrong?  I would really like
to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it.

I also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music
won't play either - I get the same dialog box.

The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI, ATI OPL3 MIDI, and Vanilla.
I have tried using all three.

Any help, suggestions, shoulders to cry on, etc. would be appreciated

Shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,
friends, and bulletin boards. I don't think people have any problems
getting hold of it.

Fill gaps in Dos? There's no need for many people - Dos 5 provides
more services than I need as it is. I just run Windows on top of it.

BTW, my Windows must be an operating system - it provides a Disk
Operating System that Dos can't access. (NFS...) :-)

This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their 
command line.

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR
(Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can
take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit
the document w/o re-typing it... However, I found that the OCR that comes
packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional (also
by Delrina software)... So, once again, WinFAX ver. 3.0 has what you are
looking for... Good luck!

	This is one of the trickiest problems w/ Win 3.1 ... Personally I run
Telix 3.2 for DOS under Windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the Win
version froever... :) ), but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule:
I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines, most of
them w/ big problems... Some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 
1) ALWAYS run the prog thru a .PIF, never by calling its .exe, 2) In the .PIF
_always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something
MS points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading
3) Go under Ctrl Panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
--it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) Check where
are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from
your BIOS setup and from Ctrl Panel/Ports/(Setup?)/Advanced..
These might help u... If yu still have problems, get $100 and buy Procomm+Win..,
:) Hope it helps somehow...

	I don't think the question is:
		""will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?""

	A more important question is:
		""will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps
		from subsequent Windows versions in the future?""

	Can it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps?
	OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.
	After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to
	view Microsoft code.  After that, the only way to maintain
	some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would
	you want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?

Excellent suggestion, Ron.  And as a further comment on DOS 6, if
you decide to install Windows standalone configuration completely,
in more than 1 directory on your hard drive, and use DOS 6 to
jump to a specific copy for each user, you could be saving yourself
many megs of disk space if you use the SETUP /N and /A technique!!

I posted a message here some time ago asking why my mouse was so jumpy.  
Well, I think I know why, and it doesn't have anything to do with the 
mouse.  It seems to be the video driver!  Here's why I think that:

A few weeks ago I helped a guy install the driver for his S3 video card for 
windows.  He had been using the normal Windows default VGA driver.  We don't 
have the same kind of mouse (mine is microsoft serial and his is an off-
brand serial mouse).  His mouse worked fine until I installed the S3 (v1.4) 
driver on his system, then his mouse became really jumpy too!

Is there anything I can do?  I need high resolution since I display LOTS of 
stuff on my screen (AMI Pro, Pegasus Mail for Windows, WP Office 4.0 -- 
sorry, nondisclosure!, and alot more).  I noticed there are S3 drivers on 
ftp.cica, but they are the same version that I already have and they are no 
help (I already tried!).

If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS/2
2.1 since it will be released at Comdex that day. It will run Windows
3.1 apps and Windows enh. mode. If you can't wait, then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product.

When you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task. The real power of OS2
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch.

Happy benchmarking.

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputes
that OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an 
individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that
question. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2
and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work. Go to your local computer store to answer this one.
I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. This
is where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has won
the single user PC war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0.
Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'
of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho.

No, but...

You can allocate real static data within code segments!
When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.

You can forget most of what was written about memory management. Under 3.1
you have paged virtual memory. You can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager. You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock/
Unlocking the memory block.

An besides: DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called
by another task.

Autodesk Animator is a good tool. The one I like is Show Partner/FX. If
you want it, I could give a copy to you. I did a lot of advertising with it -
it lets you create both graphics (ANY resolution) and text frames, run it all
as a ""film"", you can make choices and include music - I guess that's just
what you need. If you're really interested, email me.

You can't customize a command line interface?  Where have you been?  I
can change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is
used to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a
directory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line
interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh,
sh, etc...)

A decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif?
Or the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty
standard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows
with the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit
easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now...)

The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows (all flavors) and the other ""power"" users running Unix
and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty
much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo
over to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it
too.

Why should he have to?  This sort of thing should be included.  How about
the millions of people who don't have access to pd libraries over networks?

Just because people can work around it, doesn't mean that something shouldn't
be done to remedy the situation.

I am running Windows 3.1 on a 386SX-16 MHZ with Five Megs of Memory.

The motherboard came with one meg, and I added the four megs this past
weekend.  They were 1X9 70 Simms.

I had installed in the application menu MS-DOS command PARK.  Up till
today, it parked the disk from the application menu without any problem.

When attempting to park the heads today, I received the following
message:


STOP        This application has violated system integrity due to
            an invalid general protection fault and will be
            terminated.

What does this message mean?

I'm not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the 800k
disk.  I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a
PC 3.5"" can't read it.  This is a hardware problem which software cannot
correct.  Hope this helps and correct me if I'm wrong.

These are perfectly valid points and I agree. I'm glad we (MS) are starting
to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future 
releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the 
mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over
the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS
(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.
The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people
until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the 
wayside.

Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to
be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either
stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that
point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the
short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS
3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.
Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of ""real"" OS features (I work on NT and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago).

	...Dave

Of course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.

PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product.  It can handle TIFF, GIF,
BMP, PCX, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between
them.  There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations (I'd try
ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  Log in as ftp, use your username as a password,
and look for a program called PSP101.exe or something like that.  I have
the registered version, and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it.

Once again, FANTASTIC software.  Up to 24 bits, huge images, everything.

You're right.

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 3.5"" disk or Apple II
5.25"" disk without extra hardware. However, Mac 1.44MB disks can be read
and written in a PC 3.5"" HD drive with software only.

Many thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested
in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my
limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, 
when it is ready.

The responses I received are summerised below:

Kevin Donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that Michael Everson
(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and
that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging 
IR 100 (about $160) for each one.

pbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are ""Durrow"" and ""American 
Uncial-Normal"".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for.

Finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the ""Meath"" font
included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package
is very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for
info but got no reply.

So that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available.

Well, you can't say that it don't work.  The inability to read 800k mac
disks is not a SW problem.  Rather, it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs. 

I have seen a post about a program able to read non-1.44Mb Mac disks,
which comes with a watchamacalit <ma memory's faling> card, which you
just drop into a com port or something.  Don't remember specifics, tho.

In trying to use the Equation editor in Word for Windows 2.0 I get
a couple of error messages along the lines of:

>Can't find font MT Extra for default printer. Some characters my not be
>displayed or printed.Try installing Equation editor again or reinstall a 
>new printer.

Similar for the font Fences.

I know I have these fonts on my system but are unable to use them.
I have tried both of these solutions to no avail.

If anyone has had similar problems and has found a way to fix this, could 
they let me know. It is urgently required !!

A program called Mac-ette allows you to read Mac 3.5""
high-density disks on a DOS machine. You can get the program from
simtel-20. I'm not sure of the directory location.

Do you mean that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior in _some_ respects (which
is trivially true), that it is objectively inferior in _all_ respecets
(which is trivially false) or do you mean something else? What criteria
have you chosen for your objective assesment? Are you sure that these
criteria are themselves objective?

IT'S BACK!!!!!!

Congratulations, you've just discovered a very nasty, and very frequently
ecountered, bug in the Word Setup program. Once you know what is wrong, it
is quite easy to fix. Go into the Fonts dialog under Control Panel, and select
the two fonts MT Extra and Fences. Delete them, but only delete the list
entries, not the disk files. Now select Add, and add the fonts MT Extra Plain
and Fences Plain. Close the Font box, close Control Panel, and restart Word.
Everything should be alright now.

Does anyone know if Microsoft has fixed this thing yet? They HAVE to know
about it by now, it's been so frequently reported.

Subject: logic of backup?
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL

I have been backing up my hard drive ever since I had to re-install
everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't I?!).
I am using a windows-based backup program (actually Norton), and I 
began wondering about the logic of this.  Sure, if I accidentally delete
a file, I can get it from the archive.  But what if my disk crashes again?
I would not be able to start windows to run the backup program!  (Note,
by crash, I mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine
from booting properly.  I think I gave up too early, but I didn't have
the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was.  My
hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. Yeah right...)  This whole scenario
is complicated by the fact that I am using Stacker.

So I think there are 2 possibilities:

   1) I'm right.  If my disk really crashes, I would at least have to
      re-install DOS and Windows to get the backup program working.
   2) I'm wrong.  There is an easy way to make a ""mirror"" of a hard disk
      that can easily restore it's state from scratch.

The polls are open...

This is indeed true. I prefer Windows NT. It is certainly much better
than Microsoft Windows 3.1/DOS.

Excuse me? Are you one of those people who *enjoy* working w/win? Come talk 
to a house-mate of mine and tell him how productive his life is when he 
encountered yet another sudden appearence of the DOS-prompt while cutting 
and pasting in win! Or an empty win screen without any tasks running (i.e.
^ESC brings up an empty list, progman has done it again.)

On all 1.44Mb drives (both Mac and PC), the disk spins at a constant
RPM.  On 800k Mac disk drives, the spin rate of the disk is varied so 
that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed; a slower rotation
for the outer tracks, and a faster rotation for the inner tracks.  A PC
needs special controller hardware to make this happen.

In the newer versions of Norton Backup for Windows (2.0 at least)
there is an ""emergency"" disk, which will allow you to restore
from tape without reinstalling DOS/Windows (I understand it's sort
of cumbersome to use, but not nearly as much as reinstalling
everything!)

I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS/2.  
Considering that OS/2 is a multi-threaded true multitasking OS and
takes the place of DOS and Windows and more, I actually think the 
requirements for OS/2 are very reasoable.  I also think that anyone
using Windows 3.1 without 8 megs of RAM, a 386-40, and 200 megs of
hard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  Those are
also legitimate requirements for OS/2.  In fact, the requirements 
for Windows 3.1 and OS/2 are about equal.

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my

are many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes
the Wabi (Windows API Binary Interface...I think) technology that wil
run Windows apps straight outta da box.  If this flies in enhanced mode,
then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education
market.

Too big and complex for the home front...Windows 4/Mac Sys7 will take those
while Win4Wkgrps - NT - OS/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses.

However, once the PowerPC becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form)
then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix
machine at work and yet still run Windows/Mac apps at home is going to be real
attractive to alot of people!!!

Just my predictions.

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list.  But we have
strayed from the original topic.  Our computer environment is pretty split
between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  But
there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users
here.  The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter
which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively.  For the PC there
is no equivilant... that I know of!  Both mac-ette and macsee have been 
inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity
in a DOS program to selectively transport the files.

The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is 
in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  It is quite
clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies.

My Windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry.  Whenever I try to run
Windows now, the logo comes up OK, but when it tries to enter Windows
itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong
graphics mode or something.  It's completely illegible although functional
as I can still exit to DOS with an ALT-E RETURN combination.

I tried to reinstall Windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the
installation process, install takes you into Windows and there my graphics
problem surfaces again so I cannot complete the re-installation.

All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my
config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before
this problem cropped up.

I'm running a 486-33DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM (I've resinstalled the
Stealth video drivers again but with no luck).  I'm also using QEMM and
Stacker 3.0 but Windows is installed on an un-stacked partition.  And of
course, it worked perfectly before.

Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Using the software you're using, I agree with you there.  What I did:
I installed DOS, Windows and CPBackup (functionally the same
as your Norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the 
DOS ""backup"" command on just that much.  To restore, I boot to the 
""system"" diskette, and use DOS ""restore"" to read in that much, then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB (Norton, in your
case), overwriting what I've just restored.  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization
on the ""real"" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.

Seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a ""system"" floppy.  Then you could restore it all on one ""go"".

Please....Apples to Apples.  Nt is a beta, and as such cannot be accepted as a

It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on
an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software.

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing
budgets that MS do.  4DOS, for instance, is everything that
COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS).  Those who
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  But they
have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  It seems to have worked
pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually
likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine.  That's okay, marketing
isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's
superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way.  They have a lot
more to be proud of than MS does.  If MS really gave a damn, they
could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
compatability issues and absconding with the technology.

DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
marketing and vendor agreements.  The ""mediocre"" was excusable in the
early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years
to play with it.

An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least
have the names buried in the files.  Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0
and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?

The easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network. 
This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you don't have to worry
about losing the resource fork of the file, often a problem when sending binary
files from a PC to a Mac.

Cliff, do you know the difference between ""Windows"" and ""Win-OS/2""?  Here's
a helpful hint:

Running ""Windows"" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS
box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1
no longer has a ""real mode"".

The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows
clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added
by IBM to ""Win-OS/2"".

Now, everybody who is running ""Windows"" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2
2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running ""Win-OS/2"" under OS/2,
raise YOUR hand.

Get the picture, Cliff?

Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server.  
The WinHelp() function, as I am told by MS, does search your path so 
relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include
the path to where you move them to, however, if an application has 
hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it
searches the given path (i.e. WinHelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for example) then
WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory
where you have installed your software.

I tested this out on a variety of software packages.  I moved all my 
helpfiles to the drive z:\ and included this in the path statement.
Here is the results for different software packages:


Norton Desktop			Found Helpfiles
Windows V3.1 for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles
Windows V3.1			Found Helpfiles
MS Powerpoint V3.0		Found Helpfiles
MS Word				Found Helpfiles
MS Excel V4.0a			Did Not Find Helpfiles (strange)
MS Foxpro V2.5 for Windows	Found Helpfiles
Lotus Amipro V3.0		Did Not Find Helpfiles
Procomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles


I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to 
specify a global path for helpfiles.  

If anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something
out please let me know.

Microsoft has a division called Microsoft Consulting that does what
IBM FEs (field engineers) do.

However, neither company just up and sends consultants to client sites. 
Both companies charge very high hourly rates for on-site consulting unless
the client has already paid an annual service contract.

Hmmm.  I gave two examples which matched your objective criteria, and your

unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly. 
 
What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My
experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print
ok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will
print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. 
 
When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change 
the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,

You might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third
parties.  Norton Desktop for Windows, for instance.

Personally, I *like* File Manager, which comes with Windows.  It's much
faster than NDW's, and the File Manager that's part of Windows for
Workgroups even has a decent button bar.

That first you can do with File Manager, but the others you'll need
to look at NDW or PC Tools for Windows, etc.

Summary: Microsoft Botches it up!

Organization: University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia
Lines: 236

(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over
a week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)

Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the
pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story
but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the
potential pitfalls of ""upgrading"" to DOS 6 that I have been able to
notice after only about a week of playing around with it.

My envorinment
==============

TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk
System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments
CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel
Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments
Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-
Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs

After ""updgrading"" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things
became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In the
process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.


Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive
==================================================

While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain
applications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is
that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to
consider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)
and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).

The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from
factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when ""upgraded"" to
DOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of
more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew
that DS compression must cost something.

Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually
*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than
I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings
in I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large
random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.

While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or
sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on
WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.

The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv
on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective
statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or
even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and
slow disk I/O'.

This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why
'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.


Double Space and Windows
========================

DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you
wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that
matter even check on its usage -- try ""fasthelp dblspace"" in a dos box
within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you
get.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.

Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to
file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed
floppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed
floppy if you dont know how to.)


DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM
==============================================

Defragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited
patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.
This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take
no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)
but it took 12 minutes.

I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran
faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this
had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)
module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,
and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After
disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.


Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots
====================================================================

In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following

	Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup
	for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in
	your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you
	run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.

If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it
means ""disable all power saving features of your notebook"".  Why would
anyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only
does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the
readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what
else) are crippled by the TI's power saver.

It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If
there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI
programmers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have
to guess as to who are the idiots.

By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE
in DOS6, when you check the status, it says:

	Power Management Status
	-----------------------
	Setting =  ADV: MAX
	CPU: idle 60% of time.

This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook
when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in
iconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all
for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is
such an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating
system or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%
idle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type
of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'
example of our times!


Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming
===================================================

I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of
addpath statements like this:

	set PATH=C:\DOS
	...
	set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN
	...
	set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS
	...
	set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN
	...
	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%

Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old
one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every
path statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value.  As a result, my
resultant path has so many DOS's.

If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add
the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement
containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.
(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a
directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)

Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)
decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and
prepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it
would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.

I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft
representative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he
specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the
information to him as he did not have access to internet.

Now that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement
with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement
should not be touched for any reason?

As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to
understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:

	set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE
	set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%
	loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM

Guess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with

	LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM

Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its
parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.


DOS 6 Software Quality
======================

DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,
you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the
commands that come with it.

I am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to
use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont
within a week, I will post how you can create this ""ghost"" file.

Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a
particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)
programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find
it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft ""tests the quality"" of
their products.

I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to ""test quality""
when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but
can only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any
form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs
that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond
repair!

Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk
is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the
defragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated
when I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive
defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and
with no new file creation since.

Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you
admit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we
should watch out for if we have already used DS.

Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better.

1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.
   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You
   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left
   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your ""left
   and right window"" as you can have as many open as you wish instead 
   of just two.

2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking
   on the executable's icon.

3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double
   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have
   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The
   ""browse"" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you
   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.
   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your
   requirement for ""text reading and graphics viewing"".

I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up
all the associations you need is the way to do it.

If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be
pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how
some things are done.

I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,
show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very
convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university. 
The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the
program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion
sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19
(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
windows program start.

Very well indeed.  At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch
an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  It drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every 30 seconds.  An ISA Graphics+ was able to do ""Zoom by
2"" without any perceptible performance penalty.  It is the best performance
I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which
uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA
bus at any point).

No.  It is technically inferior to the OS/GUIs that I listed.  I have already
described why.  To say briefly:

System 7 --easier to learn and use.  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect.
OS/2     --Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking.
NeXTSTep --easier to learn, use, and program. More stable multitasking
UNIX/X   --As easy to learn and use.  More stable multitasking.

With the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as
well as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not
an issue.

By this criterion, it is inferior.  If you have another, then perhaps I am
incorrect.  Do you pick up the glove?

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1.
Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being
executed from the DOS directory.

Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not,
I don't know what might cause the startup delay.  My testbed for DBLSPACE
(which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't
eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in 
about 20 seconds from the ""Starting MS-DOS"" herald to the end of the
AUTOEXEC.BAT execution.  I don't have handy a system with a more
realistic volume of data to time.

The following three are not the competition for Windows 3.0 (IMHO of course)
System 7  -- Does not currently run on Intel boxes
NeXTSTep  -- Rather expensive should be a competitor to Windows NT not 3.x
Unix/X    --   ""        ""        ""    "" ""      ""     ""    ""     ""   ""   ""


With the exception of OS/2 all of the above will require most users
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that
run under these OS's. And basically money speaks louder than anything
else. You keep saying ""More stable multitasking"" is what you mean
""Not Multi-finder / GEM / GeoWorks co-operative multi-tasking but
real honest to goodness prioritized pre-emptive multi-tasking""?

Basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for
quite a long time, but are still to blind to know it.

Why pick it up? You stated the reasons behind your opinions. Stated them in 
a very straight-forward, though over protective, manner. And aside from
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor, I think we are in
agreement.

their continuing development? 

I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.
It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUI
that are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.
It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..
but they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operating
system, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
my tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common
user to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things 
do) and they either puke or faint.  

If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  But
for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware
that it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..

Oh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applications
they have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..

Note that the filesize .dll is a part of the Windows Resource Kit. If
you install it (and you can download it from Cica), it will make the
appropriate changes itself.

Sorry, I don't have the demo, but I do have the program and have been
using it for the past few weeks.  Since I now have Dos 6 as well, I
don't use many of the features of PCT4Win.  But I do so use:
	- the PCT Desktop with drag and drop printing, folders in
          folders, and multiple desktops
	- the file manager which is far superior to win 3.1's fm.

 Many thanks for the replies I received to this. A couple of people
suggested how I could get the paint package to work properly, but in the
end I took the advice of someone else to try Paintshop Pro from
cica.indiana.edu.

 Thanks again.

I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem.
When using the windows terminal application, the only way
I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2,
then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine.
(I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have
anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual
for all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is 
jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't
use the second serial port and the modem at the same time,
but I'm not using the second serial port anyway.
Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem
and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end
answers.  Don't know if that helps any.

Thanks,

Subject: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro problem!
Lines: 21
Organization: Philips Research

I have the following problem on a Dell 450SE with the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 
EISA:

When I start Windows, the first 5 times I try to run an application, it does
not start. Windows will show the following error message:

   Error Executing application. There is not enough memory to run the    
   application.

After the first 5 tries, the application I want to run will start, and 
afterwards there are no more problems. When I change the Video driver from 
Mach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI 
drivers (I tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver).

Does anyone have a clue?

OK, now you are starting to define your criteria.

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that.  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said
earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.
But some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the
other systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer
support, GUI etc.)

[ BTW, I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIX/X is as easy to
  learn as Windows! ]

But I might even agree that, on balance, MSW3.1 is technically inferior to
some of the competition. This still does not prove your point.

|>  If you have another, then perhaps I am incorrect.

Range of available applications? Base OS cost? Cost of applications? Cost
of hardware? Multi-platform support?  Quality of the after-sales service?
Availability of books/training materials? Support for visual and physical
handicaps?  Suitability for use in mobile computing? Quality of
Documentation?

If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on
an OS, or indeed the primary factor, you need to think again.

I've recently re-uploaded to cica the current (v2.8) version of the working 
model of MicroCal Origin, a scientific and technical 2D/3D graphics and data 
analysis package for Windows 3.x. The working model is 2D only and puts a
promo message on hardcopies, but is largely identical to the full version.
Saving Origin files is disabled, but you can save ASCII data sets produced
with Origin. It also says it has an expiration date of Sept. 1, 1993.

Try it. You may like it, as I do!

It's currently at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.17) in the directory
/pub/pc/win3/uploads as ORIGIN2.ZIP. The file ORIGIN.ZIP is, unfortunately,
incomplete (SORRY 'BOUT THAT!).

 I just removed an IDE drive and reformated two SCSI disk to use as boot disk

meg RAM, and an Adaptec 1542b with bios enabled. System runs fine and runs 
Windows in standard mode fine, but it returns to the DOS prompt when trying 
to run 386 mode. I've tried EMMExclude and SysROMBreakPoint. What gives??????

Thanks in advance, Hal
