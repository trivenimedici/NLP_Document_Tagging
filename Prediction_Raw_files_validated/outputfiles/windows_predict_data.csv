Subject: X Server scanline padding question
Nntp-Posting-Host: bach.coda.cs.cmu.edu
Organization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon
Lines: 42


I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display
hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat
commonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler.

I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit
720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |
xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed
version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is
using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it
seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to
a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which
isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in
mit/server/include/servermd.h:

----

#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32
#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5
#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2

---

to:

---

#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16
#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4
#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2

---

Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either
(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being
built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte
boundries?

I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.

Thanks

Subject: Callback parameter problem after X11R5 upgrade
Organization: Hughes Aircraft Company
Lines: 24


We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems
with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to
the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the ""w"" of
(w, client, call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some
instances, but bogus in other instances.

We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23
patches (with the MotifBC flag set), we recompiled Motif and then we 
recompiled the application.

Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should
have used?  Should we have left Motif alone?

Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Kathy

Subject: Connecting a digitiser to X (REPOST)
Organization: Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Salisbury, South Australia
Lines: 32
NNTP-Posting-Host: caesar.dsto.gov.au

Hi there

(I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting
here.)

I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720).
It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial
port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.

The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from
devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).
I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?

What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a
specific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?
Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are
there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers
- Vaughan

From: visser@eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au (Martin Visser)
Distribution: world
Nntp-Posting-Host: eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au
Lines: 27

I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I
decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling
XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are
waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).
I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis
it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString
was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor
was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating
was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that
says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.
We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.

Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for
*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply
type ""make"" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:

	#include ""TeX.tmpl""
	PaperFormatA4()
	SimpleLatexTarget(document)

The generated Makefile provides the following commands:

    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    \input{somefile}

    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file

    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen

    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps:    Display it

    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If ...

a) ...this seems attractive to you,
b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,
c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   (however, the German version is completed and included),

then you are invited as a beta tester. I am looking forward to your e-mail.

Subject: German keyboard ALT-GR ?
Keywords: ALT-GR german keyboard
Organization: Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, Muenchen (Germany)
Lines: 25


Hi ppl,

I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german
keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german
keyboard in the textmode works just fine.
I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X
called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr.
My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :)
There's still a little problem I can't solve however:
I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets.
The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work.
I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.
Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry ""Mode_switch""
which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem
to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash
The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified
key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd??
My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't.
If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them,
help would be appreciated.

I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes

my X Application. I tried
to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the
problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't
returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and
It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and
exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput
call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.

I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may
be able to clarify.

1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!
   Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork
   my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How
   should I call this processes.?

2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more
   than one servers input.

Try to run Xsun under truss(1).

	The best way to do this is by logging in over the network
	and typing:

	truss -t open Xsun

open(""/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.dir"", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8

This will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be.

If you have defined  a project root and done a make install, everything
should have gone right by default, even without symbolic links.

It really bums me out that xv went shareware.

 * XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                       What does this mean anyway?  Can I sit in a company
                       and look at pictures off the net in my spare time?

 * amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of

 * larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more
 * can receive a Real Nice bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
 * charge.
 *
 * Commercial, government, and institutional users MUST register their
 * copies of XV, for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just $25 per
 * workstation/X terminal.  Site licenses are available for those who
 * wish to run XV on a large number of machines.  Contact the author
 * for more details.

Now since universities are institutions (right?), doesn't this mean that
most everyone in the world is affected by this?  (I don't believe there
are that many running X windows at home yet, relatively speaking).

Can the author legally sell xv?  Xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed
by others.  Did the author get permission to sell these works?  Did
the author also get permission from all the people who contributed to
xv to sell their work as well?

My guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author
maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product,
and support for xv will begin to slide downhill.

If this is the case, then that's a bummer.  I really liked xv.

Subject: Cannot create 24 plane window
Organization: Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita, Copenhagen
Lines: 59

    Hello X'ers

I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The
following code illustrates the problem:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>

main()
{
        Display *display;
        Window win;
        XVisualInfo vinfo;
        Colormap colormap;
        XSetWindowAttributes attributes;
        XEvent event;
        Status status;

        display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,
                &vinfo);
        if (!status){
                fprintf(stderr,""Visual not found\n"");
                exit(1);
        }
        colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),
                vinfo.visual,AllocNone);

        attributes.colormap=colormap;

        win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,
                0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);
        XMapWindow(display,win);
        for (;;){
                XNextEvent(display,&event);
        }
}

I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP
9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),
both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on
HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the
combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.

As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give
a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the
visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What
am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the
same error.

That's expected. The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the
MenuButton section of the ""Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface""
documentation states

      bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label.

One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap
resource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be able
to set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be the
size of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set the
button's dimensions to match its size.

Wasn't the shareware fee a ""suggestion"" by John?
Is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
honour it and part with money.  Personally if I was in his position I would
do exactly the same thing, John has obviously put in lot of time and effort
into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.

Subject: Button sensitivity problem: MOTIF app under OpenWindows
Nntp-Posting-Host: nscultrix2.network.com

The MOTIF application consists of multiple Transient shells as children 
of a single TopLevel shell:

+-----------+   +---------------+   +----------------+
| AppShell  |---| TopLevelShell |---| TransientShell |
+-----------+   +---------------+ | +----------------+
                                  |

                                  |

While a Transient shell is popped-up, my application modifies the 
sensitivity of a button in the TopLevel shell which is hidden by the 
Transient shell window.  When the Transient shell is popped-down, the 
button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged 
(i.e., solid/shaded).  Subsequent selection of the button causes the 
text to revert to the correct visual state.

When tracing event messages sent to the application, many of the events 
seen under mwm are not present under OpenWindows.

If anyone has any suggestions or solutions please post or send me mail.
  Thanks!

xv's been shareware for about a year ... hadn't you noticed?
I don't have a problem with this.  John Bradley has put a *hell*
of a lot of work into xv, and if he feels that it's time to get
some monetary reward from it, that's surely his right.

Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG
code (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have
observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware
and commercial software.  Sam Leffler's libtiff copyright also grants
permission for unrestricted use including resale.

""Commercial""?  There's a big difference between a polite request
for a voluntary donation and commercial, it's-illegal-to-copy-this-
and-we'll-sic-our-lawyers-on-you software.

I do agree that John's readme file could be a little clearer about
what he means by personal use.

You have to do the same sorts of things that Xt does with its main loop.
That is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a 
select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop.  You can obtain the 
file descriptor of the X display connection using 
    fd = ConnectionNumber (display);

The functionality of the main loop dispatcher in Xt is quite useful.
The good news is, you can get the source and plagiarize!

Subject: Need help with MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE
Nntp-Posting-Host: orion.spd.louisville.edu
Organization: University of Louisville
Lines: 39

I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers
(CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but I'm running into a couple of problems.

First, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand 
how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization
turned on. 

Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I
really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority
file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support
Xauthorization.

So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with
non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based
authorization.

(Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the
heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but
non-privileged users can't do this.)

I've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way.
Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I
want?

BTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.

Thanks in advance,
Rick

How can I capture ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events in multiple clients?
I want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen.
I can get  KeyPress/KeyRelease and Pointer motion events, but if the user
is pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse doesn't move)
I can't capture the events.  

The O'Reilly Xlib Programming Manual (vol. 1) says on page 252;
   ""Only one client can select button events on any one window at one time, 
    due to the grab that automatically takes place.""  

Any help would be appreciated.

Organization: AT&T

I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse
cursor enters a window in my application.  I'm using InterViews,
but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X.
For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus
set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what
was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell
tool window to another.  Or so it seems...

My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to-
focus within my application?  Thanks for any response.

Lines: 38

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]


I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux
system.

- It must be free.
- It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600)
  No motif/openlook etc.
- It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software
  works ok.
- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents
  with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one
  of the supported formats to ps.
- It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).

I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have
no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are.

- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.
- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.
- support for texts in any size.
- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.
- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)
- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.
- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.
  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the
  rest of the drawing, stay connected.

Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it. 

I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs
known to work on Linux with monochrome X?

Organization: Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA
Lines: 97
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu

                          The Andrew Consortium
          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 
                         is pleased to announce

                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2
                                 4/26/93

The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was
developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other
platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to
the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the
internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory
./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5"" diskette can be
ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address
below. 

The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the
same host.

Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
AUIS to compile under AIX3.2.

-----------

The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment
on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media
applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the
capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but
also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,
equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects, including text.

AUIS has three components:

    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set
    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help
    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell
    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various
    available types of objects. 

    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented
    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,
    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
    easily as those that come with the system. 

    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface
    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of
    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails
    of related messages, and subscription management. It also
    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function
    workstations. 

The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for
the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards
for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of
the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new
editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.


Remote Andrew Demo Service

You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew
Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11
window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate
through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System
to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and
newsgroups.

To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the
following command on your machine:

	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.

Subject: X11R5 vs X11R4 Configure Event Handling
Organization: UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
Lines: 31

REPOST:

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

The patches for xv.h need to use ``#ifdef SVR4'' rather than the

Otherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 4.0.4 box

the Makefile, added -L/usr/X386/lib -I/usr/X386/include to the COPTS

   into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.

It is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had.

The AUTHOR file for xgif (an early incarnation of xv) reads (in part)

  Do whatever you want with this program, though it *would* be nice if my name
  remained on it somewhere...  Other than that, it may be freely modified,
  distributed, and used to fill up disk space.

The README file for xv 1.00 (?) reads (in part) as follows...

  NOTE:  If you like the program and decide to use it, *please* send me a short
  email message to that effect.  Be sure to mention the full name of your
  organization.  When our sponsors ask us 'what have you been doing', it would
  be most handy to be able to come up with a nice long list of organizations
  that are using code developed in the GRASP Lab.  Brownie points, as
  it were.

The README file for xv 2.00 reads (in part) as follows...

  Also, if you find XV to be nifty, useful, generally 'cool', and of
  some value to you, your donation (not tax-deductable) would be greatly
  appreciated.  $10 (U.S.) is probably a fine amount to donate.
  Folks who donate $25 and up will receive a nice, bound copy of the XV Manual
  printed on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  It'll look lovely mounted over
  your fireplace.

Which looks to me as a suggestion (see Julian's comment above).

The README for xv 3.00 reads (in part) as follows...

  XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own
  amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of
  some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly
  appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,
  larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more
  can receive a printed, bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
  charge.  If you want one, just ask.  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE VERSION
  OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING!

  Commercial, government, and institutional users MUST register their
  copies of XV, for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just $25 per
  workstation/X terminal.  Site licenses are available for those who
  wish to run XV on a large number of machines.  Contact the author
  for more details.

The second paragraph to me says that universities MUST register and
pay (a potentially) large sum of money.

XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the
show_mouse_position function. 

If the XEvent arrive in this function as 

XEvent p_event;

then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, 
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case
it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. 

By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with 
these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In 
essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. 
Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the 
value of the pressed button.

Any ideas,

Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of non-Roman fonts
for X-Windows? Especially Unicode and/or han idiographic fonts.

Also, how about conversion tools for getting PC/Macintosh fonts into a
format suitable for X? I would assume it is not too difficult for
bitmap fonts.

The FAQ's for this group and comp.fonts are not very helpful on these
questions.

Subject: XmTextField truncation with LANG bug(???)
Organization: Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN)
Lines: 42

NNTP-Posting-Host: spcsun18.bbn.com

I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about
this problem........

- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded
  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.
  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting
  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables
  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,
  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything
  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.
  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual
   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)
	
- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up
  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   
  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources
  are set to japanese fonts.

- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially
  created with UIL. 


The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting
XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable
alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)

I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not
properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the
source to look at it is just a guess.

Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,
or if you want the sample program.

THANKS!!!!!!!!

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in
ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window
is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. 
At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.

If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after
wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the
same.)

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information
in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5
public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details.

I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through
the XView xv_get() function:

   x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X);
   y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y);

For example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up
in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size
handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on
xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame,
XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out
(by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the
first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What
gives? Any help most appreciated!

P.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the
window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around
frames, etc.?

I've found that I have to add the ""-8"" option for displaying JPEGs
with the new version.  For some reason, if I don't, it goes into
24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors 
(from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  Since I'm

Hi!

Personally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a  
burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  
than I like C++.

But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  
MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  
that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  
prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  
to do real work.

Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews  
(what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I  
started with NeXTSTEP.)

Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of ""changes"" that the GNU

Anyway, at SIMULOG, we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide-

another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created
using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The
image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because
the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.

I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay,
performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work
because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap.

Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or
is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap
but couldn't get that to work either.

Any help would be appreciated.

It's a request to personal users; it's a requirement for commercial,
government, and institutional users.

Someone else asked whether the authors of the JPEG and TIFF software had
given permission to incorporate their code into a commercial product.  I
found the following in jpeg/README:

    We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
    basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability
    claims are assumed by the product vendor.

and the following in tiff/Copyright:

    Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sell this software and
    its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee, ...

Looks like he's OK on that account.

We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals.  I have the article from Jim
Morton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information
that will help me decide which to buy.

The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM,
running OSF/1.  From what I have found out so far, it would be best to run
as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm,
etc.), and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal
(where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to).

What should I be looking for?  What sort of questions should I be asking
the salespeople?

The problem was that TextField was improperly walking the string; it used

The problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic

I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern 
and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern 
of the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width 
is an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the 
pattern towards the right.  Another problem, whether it is an even 
multiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels 
apart.


extern	Display	       *dpy;
extern	Window		xid;
extern	GC		gc;

extern	int	Max_X, Max_Y;		/* set in resize handler	*/

dither(pixels)

	char	*pixels;		/* dither pattern data		*/

		if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT)

		else
			*bmp &= ~(2<<j);	/* pixel off		*/

		if (++j > 7)
			{
			bmp++;
			j = 0;
			}
		}

	stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy, xid, bm, Max_X, Max_Y);
	free(bm);

	XClearWindow(dpy, xid);

	XSetStipple(dpy, gc, stipple);
	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillStippled);
	XFillRectangle(dpy, xid, gc, 0, 0, Max_X, Max_Y);
	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillSolid);

I suspect the answer is to pad the data.

That's not all it says.  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8
of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions), where there is about 
10 pages on how to specify translations to capture
various combinations of keys or buttons.

The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage
of how that works in Volume One,  chapter 9.  You should read this
to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything
complicated.

We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. 
So far I've drawn the following conclusions:

1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs
2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit
3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)
4) tcl/tk is a little buggy
5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)
6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.
7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)
8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work
9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?
10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.

I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.

thanks

He isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely
correct.  Here is the new implementation of XmpTableNewProposedLayout
which will be released with the next update in 5 weeks:

Xmp/Table.c:

void XmpTableNewProposedLayout( tw )
    XmpTableWidget tw;
{
    XmpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );
    XmpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );
    XmpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */

    /*
     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.
     * However, Motif is broken so that we actually may already have
     * been resized.  In that case, the proposed layout is already
     * forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.
     */
    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )
    {
        XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );
        XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );
        XmpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );
        XmpTableSaveProposedLayout(     tw );
    }
    /* else the resize has already been done.  Our proposed layout would
     * have been forgotten in the process.
     */
}

The XpTable the fix is identical, except of course for the names:

Xp/Table.c:

void XpTableNewProposedLayout(  tw )
    XpTableWidget  tw;
{
    XpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );
    XpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );
    XpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */
    /*
     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.
     * However, some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may
     * already have * been resized.  In that case, the proposed layout
     * is already forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.
     */
    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )
    {
        XpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );
        XpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );
        XpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );

Just create the window in the place you want it and set the program
position field in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property, then map it.

Then, assuming they have a non brain dead window manager, the user can
say whether they want to us program specified positions or not. For
tvtwm the UsePPosition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this.

Now, I'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news

Hello,


Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows

tables to implement this.  We have only succeeded by assigning the
translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single
application.  The Xt calls we make are included below.

It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation
table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations,
and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications.  If someone could
describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group, I'll take the
liberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply
you should send mail to support@qdeck.com.

A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps
ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on 
what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances
of some really nasty program like ""Smoking Clover"" would make the link 
useless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly
updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real
world, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.

Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have
to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very
good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth
links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they
often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database 
remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always
at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview
X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having
a long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about
how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.

Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.
Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy
and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a
little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen
that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server
that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough
memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network
traffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a 
solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite
easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send
it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw
that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be 
repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits
that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.
In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts 
that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's 
pretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost
as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.
We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver
keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in
no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a 
lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but
we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications
tell us.

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and
any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it
supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary
scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but
you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.

Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told
that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with
both color and monochrome X.

	Greetings,
	We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1
and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to
run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into
xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.

	When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when
we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.
With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually
getting munged.  

	Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine
that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having
control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the
department chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few
days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is
that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies
on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm,
and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal
server). 

	Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?
	Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?
	How about obvious gimmes?
	And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?

	Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some
information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any
notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a
Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking
at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP
platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the
Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for
PC (presumably Windows) clients?

Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be 
*much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP
(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen
a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but
are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency
for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard
PPP w/ compression and XRemote?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all
the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency
of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression
that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but
that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.

The fee is a suggestion for an individual but licensing is mandatory

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file
instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few
users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do
what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to
have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager
and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.

Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,
it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the
rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set
up as normal and inherited by everything.  You can find an almost-current copy
of our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.Z, available
from the usual places.

			     Xtern.ColorInfo, 0, &SetWinAttrib);
}


This results in a BadMatch error. Can anyone please tell me why ?

In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
requests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless.

This caused problems with performance and network traffic,
so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify
the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to
draw things in several different colors create a GC for
each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in
each drawing request.

For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article
in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics.

Will there be no chance to get the Author of this _REALLY_ superb program
to remove the 'institutional' point in his license statement ?
Or at least to say 'except educational ones' at this ?

I understand that use of this software by either commercial or governmental
users should be result in a donation to its creator, but the everytime
rare on money universities, schools or whatever else institutions should
not be restricted.

If the situation stays as is and the Author explicitely states that
he treats universities and schools as institutions in this context,
i'll have to fallback to xv 2.21 here. Maybe our disk capacity will
soon be dead, when every user has a copy of xv-3.00 in his home dir...

	Several ways are available -- pageview (which I think came

the new xv 3.00 package all do so.  I recommend the latter two,
especially xv if you want to do any conversion.

Hi all,

I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window
to show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects
expect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right
half of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is
quite simple; some aggregated code:

XFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, AnyColor, 0, 0, Width, Height);
XDraw[Line|Rect|String](...);
XCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, 0, 0, Width, Height, 0, 0);

I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2.

The question is:
  is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs), or did I do
  something wrong within my code??

Sorry for the cross-posting, but I really do not know what kind of
error it is.

For flexibility. Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information
is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_
a parameter to the drawing routines.

So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of
width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do

XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);
XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);

for this effect.

This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much
more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters
like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every
drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint()
if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers
there are Image routines.

EPS _IS_ plain postscript. It is only wrapped by some comments and stripped
of any dubious commands for compatibility. You can simply do

%!

save gsave
/showpage {} def

% Include eps file here

grestore restore

showpage

% end of file

and this way show it on it's natural page position and size.

Programs may use the %%BoundingBox: comment in the EPS file to do
arbitrary scale, rotate and translate to include it in more complicated
ways than above.

I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something.
Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment.

I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw.

What I did until now:
I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'.
Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues.
When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it.

Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ?
In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

Thanks very much in advance

We where following version of xv and I have been very surprise to discover that
the new version is a shareware: What a pitty !!! :-( .
What I found on the Inthernet was the freeware. I make myself a freeware and
I spent long time on it but I don't plain to make paid to use it. I think
if evrybody spent some time to make freeware, evrybody will be paid by the use
of other freeware.

The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial
widgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various
prices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. 

The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where 
you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you 
can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate 
widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. 
The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets
such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes
but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex 
widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. 

This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their 
databook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)

I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them.
hope this helps you.

I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change - 
Dartmouth will not be able to run xv 3.0, and I'm probably going 
to have to take v2 off line (I somehow missed the ""shareware""
designation in the README of v2, and didn't realize that we were
supposed to register).

I also debate whether this, with the new ""institutions must pay""
policy belongs in the contrib directory on export - to me, ""contrib""
means ""contributed"" (i.e. no strings, except copyright) attached.

I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like
to have the R5 server recognize the second card.


I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the
server, the second device was ignored.  

How do I setup the second card?


Note:  If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds
the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the
second card, and start a second window manager.  

Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone
out there has seen this problem already...

You need to start the X-server with -indirect its_name.

If you start it with -indirect localhost, it use the loopback adress as
it's adress. So when it try to contact another host, this one try to answer
on its loopback adress. Not good.

Remember that every machine has the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.

You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget, NetEd, 
which does exactly what you want to do. Cost is nominal 300 or so - call your
local office.  The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard
rumblings of porting to Sun, etc. so it may be worth the check.

Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works
fine, except:

on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
program don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine.
I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't
give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with
similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)

The X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a
problem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around
to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I
don't think I can find it. 

Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?

     You  should  try  having  a  .xsession  script in $HOME to do these
things.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version
(usually /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession), which should check whether you have
your won and change to that if you do.  (Take a copy of the  system  one
and edit it).

	6. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half *again*
		and convert it to *.GIF.

	7. Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile.
	8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and
		convert it to an X bitmap.
	9. Use ""vi"" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert
		the rasterfile into the ""Uncompressed X-Face"" format.
		(Lots of global ""ed"" commands, and by the time you're
		 done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!)

		[now over to the *Linux* side...]

	A. Use ""compface"" to convert it to what you see here:

Organization: The Internet
Lines: 89
Reply-To: J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.uk
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word ""help"" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored
icons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from
'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other
environments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some
other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X
consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by
X. 

Along the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used
because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it
more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there
for the 'original' format.

Lines: 123


              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists
              ---------------------------------------------
   
   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful
   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET
   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,
   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum
   for SCO products in general.
   
   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO
   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been
   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt
   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*
   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.

   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in
   accordance with accepted procedure within ""biz"".  Given the content,
   this change relocated the ""opendesktop"" newsgroup to a more proper place
   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new ""announce""
   and ""general"" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former ""sco-list@uunet.uu.net""
   became ""scogen"" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.

   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992
   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific
   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are
   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy
   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.
   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to
   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.

   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion
   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.
   
   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,
   you are now able to subscribe to the following:
   
        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription
        ---------                    -------------------------

	biz.sco.sources			<none>
	biz.sco.binaries		<none>
	biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca

   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET
   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news
   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and
   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in
   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.
   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive
   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.
   
   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion
   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a
   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.
   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate
   ""mailing list subscription"" address above, including in the message body:

	Add: subscriber_address		-eg-
	Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-
	Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname

   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know
   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled
   the same way, simply substitute ""Delete:"" for ""Add:"", ensuring that
   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list
   subscribers receive ""how to post to the mlist"" article submission
   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive
   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test
   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely
   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do
   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your
   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list
   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have
   with the site(s) feeding you.
   
   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged
   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we
   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a
   handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,
   please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.

We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.

These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:
- use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
  otherwise block (new data comes quite often)
- use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
  otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)
- update the display according to latest data and messages.

We typically have several of these running in windows,
plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.
Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.

Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.
O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also
how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.

We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.
The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.
Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.

The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready.
We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o.
Any suggestions or examples most welcome!

We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.

I have done this before, but I'm not sure I used the best approach (although
I tried several methods...).

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get
to the root window.  Now, this is not so simple because some window managers
slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,
so be sure to take that into account for further calculations.

Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using
XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.
Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the
windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.

All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the
window-manager is using.

Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate 
where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on
the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).

DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  But
I did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to
call or e-mail for further info.

I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What
is really powerful is that it can run the X server without
running a window manager. One can then run a special client
X program called a window manager, either (1) run 
motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network
traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook
from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).

This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager
(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.
(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other).

Well the question is:

  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to
  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I
  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run
  the window manager.

I use it all day every day (maintaining our ftp site and answering mail
via support@qdeck.com), and I can honestly say that in the last few
months I've never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network
manager instability. (Of course, I've crashed my machine quite a few times
on purpose, during beta testing and that sort of thing, but the tcpip
portion is quite stable...)

However, keep in mind that DVX and the network managers are only going
to be as stable as the software they sit on top of (so if your underlying
network kernel is flakey, you can't expect DVX to be terribly stable...)

It just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it. (To vastly
over-simplify what goes on, we just take the windows graphics API calls,
and translate them directly to X-protocol; unfortunately, windows was
not really written to be network-aware, so sometimes we see a speed
penalty when an app does something stupid, like sending a big white bitmap
to erase something rather than just drawing a white box; fortunately,
that sort of thing is rare...)

You need to run MS windows, which Word then runs inside. You could run
multiple windows programs within the one WinX window, and windows has
ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows, so in practice
it's not really a major problem. I have my system set up so that I can
run WinX, which automatically starts Word Full-screen (for windows), so
I never see any part of windows but word...)

I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100
to:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85

I determined that my 19"" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the
active screen area and dividing by resolution.

However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.
After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications
requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe
that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my
path, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but
not for the family I am using (Helvetica).

I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the
resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you
explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the
scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command

xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).

The command  

xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).
Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can
generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a
resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.

Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can
do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about
my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).
This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to
look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: ""Yup, thats
an inch"".  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

The colormap element of SetWinAttrib must be a legitimate TrueColor
colormap. So, use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it
in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!).

And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets, setting the visual
and colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be
wrong. But, I think this is the general difficulty.

Organization: Computing Laboratory, U of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK NE17RU
Lines: 89
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word ""help"" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

There is?  Then why does the documentation say:

The *fastest* way is to use an X server with shared memory extension. It uses
shared memory if it is a local X server (hence images don't have to be duplicated),
and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension
is not available, or if it's  not the localhost.

Yet another XView question: is there an (easy) way of detecting when a user
has resized a frame _externally_ by way of the window manager (e.g. grabbing
and letting go of the frame resize corners under olwm)? If so, please let me
know!

The x3270 at export.lcs.mit.edu supposedly does.  I use another x3270
that was cleaned up by Brian Ward <ward@math.psu.edu> which adds better
color support, and cleans up _lots_ of bugs, as well as cut&paste.
I just put it on export.lcs.mit.edu, as x3270v2.65beta.tar.Z.

While I have respect for John's ability and integrity, I really regret his
leaving just after a major release (or, more accurately, making the release
just before leaving).  Several of us are having problems with xv-3.00, and
in particular I have issues with all the fixes that have so far been made
to the Imakefiles and xv.h.  Without John to adjudicate, and everybody
posting fixes that work for *them*, chaos is inevitable; let's hope it is
temporary.

Lines: 24

Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or
modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would
say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be
circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're
not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being
a lawyer, I can't be positive.

Regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the
author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing
else.

- Brad

In general, there is no point in using XView 2 if you have XView 3 available;
it's a good idea to look for an XView 3 port first.  Moving from XView 2 to
XView 3 is usually simply a matter of recompiling, unless you've done

Yes, but it's broken on OW 2.0.  It does not handle multiple pages
well.  If you don't have the proper PostScript commands it will
draw the entire document on the same page instead of pausing after
each page.  I haven't tried OW 3.0 yet, though.

Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can
help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,
say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want
to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it
is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.

My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the ""original"" part of the
window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else
is a grey..the oval ""tries"" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that
it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in
the region that was the original size of the window when created.

For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I
resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is
is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval
only shows up in that 200x200 area.

What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a 
re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?

Second question:
Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???

Thanks,
Chris

I have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as

numerous graphics output formats (including X.)  I tried it and liked
it.  YOu may as well.

Hello everybody out there !

I'm trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 1.2.1 on a HP running

I have only hp.cf config-files for HP-UX 7.0. 

I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings.
The motif applications are compiled quite well, but they won't run.
I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ, but
I cannot fix it. The XKeysymDB-file is at the right location and it
works fine under SunOS.
Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong
config-file.

Please help me !

it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and
can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:
Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the
data  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow
link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the
picture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture
might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of
pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square
would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be
painted.

Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side
of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted
as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to
be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a
small  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the
magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X
server  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to
ask that a ""filter"" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the
only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process
(""Permission denied"" ;-), and have it open a local window?

It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up
such  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each
one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.
But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice
to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I
obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool
available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.

Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build
demos  that  can  show such things as ""If this were run across, say, a
4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.""  Then  the
customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.

If you installed X lib Xt by redefining ProjectRoot, you will find that
 during the install it recompiles one of the files in X lib that does the
search for XKeysmDB and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
ProjectRoot was defined. TO confirm this what happened, because I'm 
guessing, go to mit/lib/X and do

Get ghostscript and ghostview.  Ghostview is a postscript previewer
that uses ghostscript.

From the ghostview README:



    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.

Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.

Brief list of features:
  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring
    Conventions.
  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.
  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or
    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our
    European friends.
  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.
  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,
    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).
  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale 
    or color on a Color monitor.)
  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that
    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)
  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution
    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).

    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people
    are encouraged to use in other programs.

    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:
        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z
        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z


From the ghostscript README:

*****************************************************
* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *
*****************************************************

********
******** An overview of Ghostscript ********
********

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very
closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and

        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the Ghostscript language.

The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.
Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families:

        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible
          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;

        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,
          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,
          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;
          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX
          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;
          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;

        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;

        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler
          version 3.1 or later is required).


(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)

check prep.ai.mit.edu.  It's called fax-3.2.1.tar.Z or something to
that effect and is the software for netfax. Be forewarned that it
requires (at the moment) a fairly costly $450 fax modem with certain
capabilities to use it.

I'm using X11R5, with iso8859 fonts, my shell is tcsh with the following

This makes the Meta-{',`,^} keys behave as dead keys.

Of course, this only works for xterm. For emacs, my solution is to install the

Hope this helps,

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...)

DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard
X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft
Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing
you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine
on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display
on the net).

Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform;
many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or
no modifications. (Often, you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group
comp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com,
and I'd be happy to fill you in.

If you already own all the ""clone"" equipment then there are lots of such
programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine).

*BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone.
(From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this
is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better.
In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that
they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card,
very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP
for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole
lot of $$$$).

I can get 15"" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance
is over 80000 Xstones.....

I've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of
a piped ""tail -f"" to end up in a widget.  I've managed to make it work in
some ugly ways, but either a) X blocks on the tail and won't allow user
input, b) the ""tail -f"" functions like just ""tail"" and doesn't follow the
expansion of the file, c) the ""tail -f"" doesn't die after I've closed
the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting
for tail to die.
	I _know_ this code has to exist.  Anybody have it?  A general
popen() case would be perfered but at this point I'll take anything...
Thanks.

Hi, there,
    I'm trying to build X11R5 mit core distribution on a SparcStation running
SunOS 4.1.1. The only thing I change is the ProjectRoot in site.def. When the
""make World"" process goes to ""cc -o xdm ..."", I get the following error:

  I'm looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows.

  I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but I'd like to be
 aware of other choices.

  Is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?

  And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive

  What about incompatibilities ? Window managers ?

  Any info is welcome.

1) Don't call going from an Amiga to a IBM 'upgrade'
2) The Amiga Workbench did the job of a Desktop manager, and there is no
   really amazing good X Desktop manager in the Public Domain.
   (I'm currently writing one... but it's in very early stage)
3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.
4) X associates icons with nothing. A number of X Window Managers associate
   icons with windows, in a way to ease window management.
   But this has nothing to do with icons of a Desktop Manager application.
5) The tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.

I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+, under OpenWindows 3.0.

The application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL
graphics library for rendering into the Canvas.

The application does real-time 2-D animation, but it does not update the
the display fast enough.
I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my
update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to
update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also, it appears to
be compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is
up, the update rate slows down even more.

Any ideas ?

I think your performance will depend upon the X server. 

I'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM (8MB swap) and
it runs just fine.  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway.

You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for $900
and be better off than with an Xterminal. IMHO.

This would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf
file (I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access 
to the X source), and could make your own bold font from this.  Since each
glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph ""bold"", and
convert the results back to .bdf format.  Then, use ""bdftopcf"" to create
the .pcf file.  Then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc (or wherever)
and include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!

  How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors

  What's happening is this,

      If I draw it using GXcopy, it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase
      it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases 
      whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw
      all of the items it crossed.  Yuch.

      If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing 
      resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of 
      underlying objects in erase mode.

  What's the solution?

- Using the ""xv_window_loop"" functions most XView objects dont work

- With the ""notify_dispatch"" explicit I have problem because:

	Yes, it is.  It is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, probably
in pub/xkernel.  

	In response to the earlier gentlemans question, you could
theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4.  The binaries available are
for the sun3/50, but the author says it could be used on most

Hi folks,

I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0,
and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs
when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files
on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under
/usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!)
Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't
know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the 
Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the 
Makefile reads 

   # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!

Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to
look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README
file.)

Email and post are both fine.

Thanks in advance,

Dave

Hi Netters,

Hi!

	I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver.

What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
xlock program.

	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen
or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a
way to find out how long the server has been idle?

I highly recommend Starnet's Micro-X.  They have versions for DOS and Windows,
with support for PC/TCP, or the Clarkson packet drivers.  I have used it
successfully with twm, mwm, and olwm, over both ethernet and SLIP.
And their tech support is top notch.  They really impressed me.

NCD just announced a new generation of PC-Xview. They
changed the name a little though and I can't remember
exactly... PC-Xsomething.

It now supports Windows and their press release
implies that since it's still priced in the $500 range
and it's so feature-full why buy anything else?

An application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  I'd like to be

(just a text window, xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered
as ALL CAPS.  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows, I want to

Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)?  Is there a
way to mess with .Xdefaults to make a category of window do this?  Any

Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System
-------------------

If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style
like this...

// mini sample application /////////////////////////////////////

class Test : public XmWindow {
	void cmd(char*);
	void quit(void*);
public:
    Test() : XmWindow(""Xm++ Test Window"") {}

	void initialize();
};

void Test::initialize() {
    XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu();

    menu->addLabel(""&File"");
    menu->addItems( Entry(""Menu Item &One"", CB(Test::cmd)), 
                    Entry(""Menu Item &Two"", CB(Test::cmd)),
                    NULLENTRY);
    menu->addSeparator();
    menu->addItem(	Entry(""E&xit"", CB(Test::quit)));

    addSubpane(Edit, ""myEdit"");
    edit(""myEdit"")->setText(""Hello World."");
}

void Test::cmd(char* n) {
	edit(""myEdit"")->setText(n);
}

void Test::quit(void*) {
	exit(0);
}

void XmApp::initialize() {
    (new Test)->initialize();
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README):

Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11
and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming
interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.
Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the
Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both
environments without changes, although many nice features are only
available when using Motif.
In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing
a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -
data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated
in rare cases.

Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to
encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many
ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,
which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications
(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and
a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).

Top level objects in Xm++:
* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout
  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw
* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface
  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this
  distribution)

Controls (children of top level objects):
'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',
'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'

The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap
format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.

Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects
Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.


CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides
components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very
simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system
(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a
software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications
with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).
If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS
Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be
our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of
the art' from 1991).
CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was
used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing
primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to
support bitmaps and some controls also.
Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always
redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an
object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.


About this first release:

Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here
for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think
I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications
for any non-critical purposes.
CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will
be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research
project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems
to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.

Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on:
  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07
  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1
  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6

Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T
standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or
above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

Excuse me, but with a 486/50 256k cache, S3 928 ISA card, 8Mb XS3 (X11R5) running 386bsd  you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt 
that your XP10 series gets. Commerical verions X servers for S3 928 cards
can get 136k xstones. So the performance is there and additionally since
is running unix multiple users can use the system which I have done in
my home setup.

Maintenance is minimal if you can read README files for the X servers and
for 386bsd.

I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems

the possibility that they are just in a different directory.  When I try to link
my program it can't find XtInitailize, XtRealizeWidget, XtMainLoop,

Command.h.  I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with
a NULL in order to compile and see if there were any other problems.  I haven't 
used a toolkit before and this is simply an example I got from the manuel.  Can
someone tell me where I might look for these calls, that is, in what file not what
directory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe
in standard directories and generally does things his own way.  (I am using UNIX)

Users can't find the cursor?  Run ""xneko"" - it'll turn the cursor into a

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.
We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-
tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,
set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough
advertising.

I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since
xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to
X10).

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.
Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it's mapped.

As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export
is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.
But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say
whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.

As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else 
than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line
of code). I'll put this on export today.

It's actually a bug in the Solaris 2.1 kernel. We could add a workaround to
xterm. open should never return EINVAL, but it does :-(

I didn't have time to update the R5.SunOS5 patch lately, but non
of the existing problems seem to warrant a new set of patches.

XDM coulda also keep the XDM environment variable. It should have inherited
it from the environment.

It's called PC-XWare.  It is based on NCD-Ware, their X-terminal
software (which , IMHO, is excellent).  PC-XWare will include
X-Remote and be optimized for 32 bit machines. It's X11R5 based.
It will support remote management, etc.

Hello,

I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help
me with it.
I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I
think 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but
nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed
to hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well.
'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some 
experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the
xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back.
I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet.
I've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0, Rev 53)
SunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4.
Please help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to
other machines but that's not what I did it for.

Thanks in advance,

monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true?
I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and
so was thinking of buying a cheap 14"" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14"" SVGA

Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86?

Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu (4.2.3 Positioning the SimpleMenu).
The reference is to the R5 documentation.

I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget. Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on. The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and
MenuPopup actions.

I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15"",200mbDISK is going to cost
/WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  Color makes it not apples/apples too.
Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC
much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and
cost more.  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC.  For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.

Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library.
For Network discussion...

Color Coordination...

    I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the
  year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow
  (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no
  one responded at all.

    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly
  you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself
  solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead
  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.
  ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,
  Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .

    The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.
  Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this
  table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.

     * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors
             EG: values   0, 128 and 255.
       This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the
       standard colors for use in icons.

     * two extra shades of grey
             EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)

     * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading
       a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.

    This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of
  posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the
  workstation.

From my own notes on this subject....

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another.
  This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current
DISPLAY that is being used.

1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual)
      Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote
  machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.

         xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge -

  This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire
  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote
  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)

     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do
  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow
  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes
  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.

     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also
  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will
  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for
  passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories.

    WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible
  in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization
  information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.
  The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from
  the view of other users.

2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable.
      This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass
  the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of
  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information
  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.
    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does
  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the
  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your
  authorization.
    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the
  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or
  stty'ing your terminal.

  ---8<---
  script for launching rlogin:
    #!/bin/sh
    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:
    if [ -n ""$DISPLAY"" ]; then
      case ""$DISPLAY"" in
        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;
      esac
      TERM=""$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`""
      export TERM
    fi
    rlogin $*
  ---8<---
  add to your .cshrc or .login
    if ( $?TERM ) then
      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then
        echo ""$TERM"" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -
        setenv DISPLAY `echo ""$TERM"" | cut '-d&' -f2`
        setenv TERM    `echo ""$TERM"" | cut '-d&' -f1`
      endif
    endif
  ---8<---
  xterm command to use
    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname
  ---8<---

3/ NFS.
     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.
   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization
   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your
   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE:

      login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host
      remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host`

4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file
      This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or
  `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.
  This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering
  the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each
  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known
  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.
    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give
  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone
  who is asking.
    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill
  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave
  up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but
  less secure.

Subject: VXT2000 Windowing Terminal Help

Greetings!


We have several VXT 2000 Windowing terminals and associated software on our
network.  We are able to open a LAT terminal window to any of our workstation
nodes but we are unable to get a LAT X session to work.

We have customized the terminal security to allow all LAT connections.

Trying to invoke a LAT X session from the VXT 2000 results in the following
message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area:

Host Does Not Support X Sessions

(The host is a VAX4000 Model 60 and does support X sessions)


Opening a LAT terminal window and logging into the server node, setting the
display variable as follows:

$ set display/create/node=LAT_###########/transport=lat

and then trying to create a decterm on the VXT as follows:

$ create/term=decterm/detach

Fails and gives the following error message:

dectermport failed to find language, XOpenDisplay("""")  returned NULL
%DECW-F-CANT-OPEN-DISPL Can't open display

The VXT 2000 is using its system defaults (ie. default font(s), language, ...)
except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling 
LAT protocol.

we have VT1200 windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
LAT X sessions.

VMS Version is 5.5-1
Running DECwindows/Motif of VAX4000 Model 60s


Please help.

I'm 99&44/100% positive that uwm isn't ICCCM compliant.  If you want it,

Subject: Help with porting screensaver function
Organization: Center for Computer Music Research and Composition, U.C.S.B.
Lines: 49

This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:



I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new
server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through
debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,
which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.

My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even
after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am
I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic
design of my function from the existing versions:

static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on)
ScreenPtr scr;
Bool on;
{

  /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */
  if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) {
		nextSetLastEventTime();
  }

  if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */
		next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle);
		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */
  }
  else {											 /* Unblank the screen */
		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);
  }

  return TRUE;
}

I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the
saver, but I cannot find where it ""wakes up"" the server and unblanks the
screen.

Any tips/help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Xt(App)AddTimeout doesn't work in xterm, because, despite appearances 
to the contrary, xterm is not really an Xt based application.  ""Other
sources"" like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterm's main
loop. So don't be surprised when you try this and it doesn't work.

I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up
to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens
when bold is displayed.  It would appear (at least in X11R4) than you cannot
display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold.
I wish someone would prove that incorrect.

Sorry, that's a feature.  The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title, so the wm is obliged to do it.  If this bothers you, complain to the app writer.

Write your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM.  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title.  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.

I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However,
after an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not
happen when I use xscreensaver. 

My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this:

xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 &

My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects
a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session.
However, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is
there a workaround?

I'd prefer responses via e-mail.

Thanks.

Keywords: geometry, mwm

Hi,

I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events,
so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in 
some sort of 'preferences' file.

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:

 XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);

This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).

However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the
XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure
structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).
The width and height memebers are correct.

When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.

Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?

Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?

I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my
application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values
for the x, y, width, height resources.

Thanks

See xwd, xpr.  Even better, grab xdump from ftp.cs.uwm.edu.  It makes use

You can dump to PostScript, bitmaps, etc.

OW 3.0 is the same.  But, the definition of broken is relative.  Pageview

You don't give the precise error message, but I assume that
the making of the target fails, because make can't find the rules.

We've seen this happen with SunOS 5.x make as well and aat this
point I'm not sure why it happens. It seems to happen
with large Makefiles. The entries near the end get lost.
Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem,
as it does in your example.

In the MIT R5 distribution + R5.SunOS5.patch this can happen with
the target ``Makefiles'' in one of the doc directories.

>At first I thought this was a bug with make on my Sun, but I built and used gnumake with the

This is really weird. Are your *really* sure that you were using GNU make?

Hi.

I'm wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module, as XKeybind.o
in a shared library, as libX11.so in Suns OpenWindows. I tried to RTFM, but
I didn't get any wiser that way. Also, can I do the same on an RS6000 machine
running 3.2.2 (if it is possible at all). I know how to do it with real 
libraries (ar). I am trying to replace XLookupString in the delivered

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous, though (see also DESQview/X,
which does this in its DOS windows).  Do you really want xterm to wake up every

After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing:

  1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation 
     problem.

  2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
     to meet your requirements.  

     This means that if you server return a response like the following

     -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1

     You can ask for the follwogin:

        -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1
 
     and it will generate it for you.  You should try to always use

Well that may be true.  However, the man page for pageview for OW 2.0
does not mention about DSC compliance.  In any event, the point here
is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will
find out that it's not a practical tool.

Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes,
most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar

Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/...
so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and 
now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them.

I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way.

Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun
(SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even 
tried hard copying all the relevant files into the ""right"" places and
every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.

I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:

The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code
that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a
widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.

But because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence
to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events
and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
interrupted.
It seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the
impression that his inputs are immediately processed ?

Has anybody an idea?

Please answer via e-mail.

Hmm, depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system
dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,
call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include
file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a 
OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to
really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically
for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file
tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all
it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type
of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 
couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the 
""drivers"" actually included from the toplevel include file will be 
compiled into emu.

It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully
relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux
system available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest
you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or
questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately
we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we 
just don't have access to that many different systems.

Subject: Creating Your own ColorMap, i.e. Lookup Table in X11 R4

Hello,

Below I have the copy of some source I am using to setup a user-specified color-
map for X R11 V4. I am attempting to create user defined colors in terms of
RGB color ranges. The calls to XAllocColor prove ineffective. 

Variables are defined are as follows:

    int                 i, j, k, lut_index
    color_type          min_image, max_image;
    color_type          image Pixel_Value_Range, last_image, start, end, jump,
                        lut [ 512 ];
    unsigned long       pixel;
    double              red, green, blue;

/*
 * Data structure used by color operations
 *
typedef struct {
        unsigned long pixel;
        unsigned short red, green, blue;

} XColor;
***************/
    XColor              rgbcolor, hardwarecolor;


With color_type defined as { double red, double green, double blue }.

to work within the call to XAllocColor:

    start.red = (int) 255 * min_image.red;	/* 0..255 */
    end.red   = (int) 255 * max_image.red;	/* 0..255 */

    jump.green  = (int) (( end.green - start.green ) / 7);

    start.blue = (int) 255 * min_image.blue;    /* 0..255 */
    end.blue   = (int) 255 * max_image.blue;    /* 0..255 */

Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX:

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine.  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Sun|s network address (/etc/hosts

machine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX.

Thanks to Bruce Barnett, who recommended xvttool, and Bernward Averwald and
Liam Quin, who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior
for a *class* of xterms.

In xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like:
""a""	""A""
""b""	""B""
""c""	""C""
...
and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate
any input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case).  Works great, and
you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side.

To use an xterm solution, add to your .Xdefaults:
capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
   <Key>a: string(""A"")\n\
   ...

or:
capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
        <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\
        <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\
        ...

and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm

Thanks loads!

What I'd like to see is this scenario: 

Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. 
Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. 
They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are
held in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of
hardware color cells of color descriptors. 

When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access
to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL
OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE
GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE
COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. 

A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)
into its associated palette. 

The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

1) locks the mouse into the window area
2) doesn't accept any input from the mouse.

Needless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an

Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif?  Is there a patch?

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt).

You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this
is the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing,
you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. 
Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean...
TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep
processing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically
re-installed.  

Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since
events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you
are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and
should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt).

Subject: 'makedepend' problem
Organization: Information Resources Inc.
Lines: 46

Hi, netters:

We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process
#if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are.
For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed
by Sun) - namely Xos.h:

#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)
#       include <string.h>
#       define  index   strchr
#       define  rindex  strrchr
#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */
#       include <strings.h>
#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */

Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements
to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist
under Solaris2.
We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.
We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.

In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's
distribution) mentions this problem:

BUGS
     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C
     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
     that all #if directives will evaluate to  ""true""  regardless
     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include
     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have
     its own parser written for #if expressions.

Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than
WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?

Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply 
directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor
exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.

Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: 

  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, 
  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, 
  Doug Young, and many others.

Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional
conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object
Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server
technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;
and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.

With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing
applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a
player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many
desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be
evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and
suppliers.

The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference
at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide
the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX
developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is
the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you
what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development
Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.

I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an
Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience
is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a
confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.

Most DOS X servers are terribly slow to use in my experience - and no, I guess 
performance would be pretty bad. I believe the discussion is valid for an X

When attempting to connect to an SGI Indigo from a PC clone using
a commercial X windows emulation package, the X package hangs in
a pre-login X screen mode.  The login box won't display.  Using
the package in 'telnet' mode, I can logon to the SGI, and run any
none graphic type things.  On the PC I get an error:
""Read error 0 on socket 1""  (raw socket error)

On the SGI, in xdm-errors:
I get a termination error when I kill the stalled screen on the PC

On the SGI, in SYSLOG:
<date><time><SGI> xdm[#]:Hung in XOpenDisplay(<remote>:0, aborting
  ""                  ""  :server open failed for <remote>:0, giving up

I have all access control disabled (I believe, SYSLOG message confirms
this when I login on the SGI).  I believe I have the SGI set up properly
as described in the X ADm. book by O'Rielly....

The X emul package tech support hasn't been able to solve the problem.

So what I'm looking for is some suggestions on where to look for problems,
and possible tests to run to narrow down the questions.

Unfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows
conference.  Perhaps some good will come of it, but the two are so dissimilar
and the NT marketing stuff is so large in the Xhibition adds that I was 
coming to a similar conclusion as Jesse...

Organization: The University of Western Australia

We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4). We have
used Xvision on a PC, setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and
allow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login: xdm will then
manage that display. I would like to do the same thing with xfree86
running under Linux, but I don't know how. I don't want to hardwire the UNIX
xdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux 
(let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision.

Can anybody help?
Thanks,

	Well, I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion.  First
get ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it.
It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the
page, and maintains page counts.  I've written a little C program to
massage the output of gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps somewhat, so that you
can get all the ascii strings in the document.  No guarantees that it
won't break up words/sentences, though - I've used it with varying
degrees of success.  Anyways, try this out, it may do what you want.

/*

So what? I'm running emu on a 25 MHz 68020 box. I cannot make out ANY
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not (If you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest PC). Since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this 
application is active anyway. To repeat it, a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software.

I received similar information/advice about what appears to be the same problem 
Benjamin has (and I still have).
NIS has all the information about the Macs
(I even put explicit entries in /etc/hosts to no avail).
Monitoring with 'snoop' on my Classic, the initial REXEC packet is sent to
the the SUN, which sends something to the correct Mac, but nothing appears
at the Mac.
'rexecd' is number one suspect, but it's more suble than the README suggests and
I haven't yet looked into it further.

It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need
to be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the
right hand is doing at Sun.  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview
program does require DSC compliant PostScript.  There was the possibility that
it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it
would stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude being
able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go
forward to the next showpage.  This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is
in the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?).

In any event, I find pageview extremely useful.  Since all of the PostScript
that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems.

Many spreadsheets do regression analysis.  The topic is also well covered
in most undergraduate statistic books.  Cubic Splines are usually well
covered in any undergraduate computer science numerical analysis text.
I am sure ge/mm has a well stocked library.

I have never used mathematica, but I would be surprised if it could not do a

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop!  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine?  That is when the
load problems occur.  If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste.

I'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
out there besides distributed or singleuser ""Workstations""!

I had exactly the same feeling.  I was depressed.  If you ever programmed

rewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc -M' or 'gcc -M' or 'gcc -MM' (which is
the one I prefer, since system headers don't change that often) for
generating the actual dependencies.  you'll still need to write the
parts that edit the actual Makefile.  I think there's a program in the
Berkeley distributions called mkdep that will do essentially this.

I'm most of the way through adding a grammar for parsing the #if expressions.
I don't know when I'll be able to get back to it; you're welcome to what I 
have so far. I haven't looked at other versions of makedepend, which may solve
the problem more elegantly.

BadWindow is an X protocol error.  If you write a custom error handler
which does not do ""exit(1);"" the error handler will return and let
your program carry on.  So, using a XSetErrorHandler is the way to
go, but never mind the longjmp.

Hi all,

I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting
my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have 
the following in my .Xdefaults:

XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1

So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT
set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that
that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,
or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters
above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example,
Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault
lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:

speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@
eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q

	I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one
here:


	Here's the ones I know of:

	Wind/U		- Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	- Hunter Systems

	MainWin		- MainSoft

	LIBWXM          - Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes.  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment, it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't
yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical
modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol.
Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful.

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at
runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708.

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses
Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon.
My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.
They're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.

HPGL does not support raster primitives, so a formatter would have to 
punt on most popular image formats.  This probably explains the lack of
translators out there.  What do you need to plot ?

Sounds like you didn't load the support for those libraries when OW3.0 was

From the FAQ:

Subject:  96)! What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]?

        In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,
to be undefined when building some X11 clients:
        _get_wmShellWidgetClass
        _get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling ""-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic"" appears to work.

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch
100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using
                        shared libXmu

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92]

A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to
get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93]

Subject: Resources and cpp - HELP!
Organization: FWI, University of Amsterdam
Lines: 35
NNTP-Posting-Host: ic.fwi.uva.nl

Hi,

I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1).

Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different
values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my
application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and
not when the resources are loaded on demand.

Is there a proper solution to this?

So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2
different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and
set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.
But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell
command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).

Furthermore, I thought of using #include ""XTerm"" in XTerm-color.
However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,
things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource
is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the
LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do
about it?

I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I
can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the
resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

Thanks in advance for replying,
Marcel.

Why do many (?) people believe that Xhibition '93 is one of the ""paid
market hype NT conferences"" (as you put it)? I for one am going, because
I, too, am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance
to learn about NT, mainly because:

  - It will be presented in X's ""home turf"". I believe that the attendees
    will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, I expect that the
    NT presentations will face a tough audience.

  - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what
    it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the
    NT technology without actually using it myself, which I don't have the
    time to do.

  - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored, there will be
    many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to
    waste my time ... in California?!?  :-)

Just my thoughts...

That are the authorisation files for the server.
Depending on what type of key your X supports they contain magic cookies,
DES based authentication or SUN DES authentication.

The place is defined with the DisplayManager.authDir 
Other things like the file name can be changed as well see XDM manual pages.

I use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas.
here's a small piece of code that uses those routines

static void Redisplay(pw, ev, region)
XtpManagerWidget pw;
XExposeEvent *ev;
Region region;

/* pp->exposure_region is an XRegion */
XtpManagerPart *pp = &pw->plotter;
pp->exposure_region = XCreateRegion();
   /* region is passed via an expose event */
if(region == NULL)
{
if (ev->send_event)  /* synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw*/
        {
        exporect.x = pw->core.x;
        exporect.y = pw->core.y;
        exporect.width = pw->core.width;
        exporect.height = pw->core.height;
        }
     else
        {
        exporect.x = ev->x;
        exporect.y = ev->y;
        exporect.width = ev->width;
        exporect.height = ev->height;
        }

stuff deleted      

/* region now contains the exposure region */
        XUnionRectWithRegion(&exporect,pp->exposure_region,pp->exposure_region);
}
else
        XUnionRegion ( region, pp->exposure_region, pp->exposure_region);
stuff deleted 
/* WE NEED to CLIP on EXPOSE REGION for REDRAWING the GRID */
        XSetRegion(XtDisplayOfObject(pw), pp->plotarea_gc,pp->exposure_region);
stuff deleted 
        /* check to see if child is exposed */
        if (XRectInRegion (pw->plotter.exposure_region,
                         child->core.x ,
                         child->core.y ,
                         child->core.width  ,
                         child->core.height ))

So, I build up a region of exposures so that when I service my container
widget redraw of rectobj children, I only redraw what need to be redrawn.

It works for me, hope this helps you.

Granted it's nothing to loose sleep over, but this is Ethernet's tragic flaw:
the more activity (especially lots of tiny activity), the more collisions
happen and the performance gets exponentially worse...  I am just now
opposing ANY kind of waste of bandwidth under Ethernet.  Although in a polling
system it would not be so bad.

	I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across

	pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that
	I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each

	I've done this fine, but I've turned up the following problem:

	When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of

	callbacks on LeaveWindow events.  This seems odd.  I would

	Is this a bug?  If not, can someone explain this behavior?

Take a look at TeleUSE, a complete UIMS from Alsys (formerly TeleSoft).
In the US, you can reach them at (619) 457 2700.

Alsys have an VMS version of TeleUSE v2.0.5 for VMS V5.5 or higher,
built using DECwindows Motif 1.0 (based on X11R4 and Motif v1.1.1).

BTW, the VMS port from the UNIX version was made at my company, and was
released in November 1992.

Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.
One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and
hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements
(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to
20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is
filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how
many processes are needed for each character.)

While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking
process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like
10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase
in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working
set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many
as 50.

If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!

Hi,

possible. Anyway, setting xlogin*backgroundPixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not
produce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and
explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing, too.

Any way to do it ?

Bristol Technology announces the availability of 
its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.

This demo showcases the two products in the form of a 
diagram editor called DE.

Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:

	 o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.

	 o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.

	 o Rotated Text support!

	 o Source code for the demo is provided.

The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).

There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory:
Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x)
HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)

If you have any questions about the demo, send an
e-mail to: support@bristol.com.

If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) 
please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.

Remember to use binary mode!


What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......
---------------------------------------------------------
Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.

			    HyperHelp 3.0
			    -------------
HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one
line function call, application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,
project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and
Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 
And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!

New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character
based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History
window.

			     Xprinter 2.0
			     ------------
Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existing/new X based applications
very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action.

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR4.2.


Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
HyperHelp and Xprinter. 

If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:
info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

				Happy demoing,



					The staff at Bristol Technology

  osfActivate             :1004FF44
  osfSelect               :1004FF60
  osfCancel               :1004FF69
  osfSelectAll            :1004FF71
and, if I take *out* the osf lines from said XKeysymDB, my copy of wscrawl
(another Motif-compiled-for-Sun program) gives the same type of complaints
as listed above.

Any tips?  I'm mystified.

Subject: xod - does it exist?
Summary: I need an od interface

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), I assume
it would be called xod.  Actually, any viewer for a core file will do.

I looked at export ( @ mit ) in the index of /contrib, but didn't find anything 
relevant.

Hi, all:
    I am studying the book --> ""UNIX Desktop Guide to OPEN LOOK"".
There is an example --> winprop.c that demonstrate how to program

It works for me.  I've run Motif 1.1.3,1.1.4,1.1.5,1.2,1.2.1, and 1.2.2 on
an X11R5 server with MotifBC defined.

Or the library might be there but not pointed to by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
