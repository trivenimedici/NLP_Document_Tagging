Somebody in comp.multimedia was also having trouble using a Spigot in his
LC III. It turned out he needed the latest version of ScreenPlay (1.1.1),
which fixed things.

I recently made the mistake of purchasing a SONY CPD-1320 monitor for my
Mac IIci.  The monitor is very good, however it seems that the IIci does not
support VGA (then why did you buy it you ask?  I am stupid I reply).  What I
am looking for is a video card, preferably 8 bit, which supports VGA.  I am
interested in any information I can get.  Offers for the sale of applicable

Hello. I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the
powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a
difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus
any other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed
by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.

I also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem
allowing speeds just as any other serial port.

My particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to
interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. 
Currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything
up just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.

Can anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  
I would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.
I will post a summary if enough response is generated.

Thanks.

You shouldn't have ignored the ZyXEL.  It can be purchased with a ""Mac
bundle"", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software.
The bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, depending
on the supplier.  It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs,
but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &D0 in the
init string, to enable hardware handshaking).

For more information on the ZyXEL, including sources, look at various files 
on sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.

Subject: IIci ROM Offers 32-bit Clean ROM for IIx
Organization: CTS Network Services (crash, ctsnet), El Cajon, CA
Lines: 17


Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey's
Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it, offering
clean 32-bit ROM code (liberating his IIx from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by Apple's 32-bit System Enabler).

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for a
remanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know that
copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to
resell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computer
involves the sale of the ROM anyway, so what's the difference?).

Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
be a reasonably price to offer?

This is a system extension for these NuBUS cards using the 
MCP (= Macintosh Coprocessor Platform). The MCP-cards are NuBUS cards with a
Motorola 68000-Processor and 512 KB RAM (expandable to 1 Meg).
MCP is a development platform for hardware-designers so they can use a card
with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards.
Currently the only cards I know are

- the Apple TokenRing-Card
- the new Apple Ethernet-Card
- the Apple NuBUS serial card

Perhaps there are some third-party-cards, but I don't know.

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications
as a self-styled ""expert"", in fact, when I read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]

Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the 
correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent
and driver-related stuff.

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but
MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.

>Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  

Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,
Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-
boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.

>Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
>be a reasonably price to offer?

Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and
Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx.

I recently got a Centris 610 4/230 on my desk. It's a vast improvement on

I've encountered a problem with fonts ..

Entries in a Filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my
previous mac using System 7.01 now look wierd !

Spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be
truncated. I'm using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes - the
increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles. 

I'm using a mixture of TrueType and Fixed-Size fonts - exactly as on my
IIsi - when things worked perfectly.

We've managed to get similar behaviour using Word 5.1.

Apple UK adopted their usual ""friendly"" approach and told us to call our
local dealer - God help us !!

Any ideas ??

I'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase.  I'm
primarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones.

When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives
seem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB
Portable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the
FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drives
use different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others.

My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser
reviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm asking
if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed
some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me
much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or 
anything else I should probably know.

Thanks.

Sure there are other considerations, but it goes to show you how
proper design from the beginning (in hardware and software) can give
you great returns.  [as well as showing you that if you don't have a 
marketing department to speak of, no one will care how good your system is]

I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is

They could have done everthing else better -- but apple didn't.

I wish I caught the original post, but anyway ...


The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as
the analog sweep board) is on its way out. Apart from a board swap (bikkies to
Apple), there's not much the average Joe can do to fix it.

You can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should
be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a
temporary fix. A copy of Larry Pina's ""Macntosh Repair & Upgrade Secrets"" is a
worthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.

I guess the real question is:

Who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_.
Are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW)
isolated from every other factor and influence in the system?  
Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)!

I just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has
_a lot_ to do with the ""power"" of a CPU in a particular application.
If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given,
then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick.  If you have to
fake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then
your cycle count goes through the roof!

well, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose.
The orginal question was about classifying micro-processors...
having re-read the entire thread, I don't think much more can be said without
getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given.


That's it for another $0.02.

Cheers everyone.

I've used Silverlinging at work (v 5.42??), and I like HDT PE much

The supplemental manual that comes with the Quadra 800 explains it. I
don't have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CD
while the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, and
then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CD
instead of the hard disk. I think the key combination is
Command-Option-Delete or Command-Ctrl-Del.

The VRAM SIMMs go in the slots at the back - closest to the power supply.

Hi,

I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when

but I can't remember the code). Looking at the motherboard, I can see
that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says ""256Kb path -
1 row"". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added.

So, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping?

It already happened as far as I know... I got some email about three

Duos dropped in price.  I think the Duo 210 4/80 is now around
US$1,8xx.

I believe the FPU on the LCIII is always supposed to go on the logic
board, not in the PDS board. I have heard of crashing problems with
PDS-based FPUs on the LCIII. Asante may have fixed them but why
bother. Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway? The
extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. I say FPU on
main logic board, in socket, Ethernet alone on PDS card, in slot.

I can produce similar artifacts.

I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16"" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD
configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram.
The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines,
will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen.
They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then
that part of the screen is back as usual.

They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left,
and are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from
using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something
perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry...


I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:
  1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?)

The person who answered was polite :-).  I also took the chance to complain
about my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a
(hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.  (I had to play
with a paperclip for about 5 minutes to get thing to eject, after which the
mac booted fine.)

Subject: LC II Slowdowns?
Organization: tfsquad public access usenet, St Paul MN (+1 612 291 2632)
Lines: 24

        I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three 
LC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My 
problem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace.
        These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD 
installed. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and 
it gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not 
the drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and 
so on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can 
think of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases 
fairly often. But nothing works.
        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always 
moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, 
for about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on 
a 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it 
nearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity.
        Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any 
ideas? They would be much appreciated.

I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
equipment :

Check for warrany tape.  If none, carefully open unit.

Inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash.

Clean up these manufacturing mistakes.

*Now* power up the unit and check it out.

I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of
the box due to sloppy QC.

PS : This goes for any manufacturer.  I'm not picking on anyone.

Now, this friend has a tendency to ""install"" things on his machine rather

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]


Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution
monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To
recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor
momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an
eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right
after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that
radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens
with no provocation whatsoever.

I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was
a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the
problem was that the 13"" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always
keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from
a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's
power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was
really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
it had to be endured.)

This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to
adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13"" monitor
owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the 
Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading
Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement
of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,
the swap of a circuit board.

I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had
experience with this sort of thing.

Um... they've sold the Cray. They realised that spending two years on
numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex
injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up
development work.
Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery
cover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three
years late.

Designing metal cases is easier - they're managing with the Calculator DA,
now it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly.

Any other suggestions?

Yup, I bought the darn thing cause it was sturdy. I carry it around in

Geez, we are a Sony familly. Our neighbor works for Zeinth and hates
it (always asks why we didn't buy Zeinth products). Nice guy
nevertheless. We still have two working Sony Color Trinitrons from
1972 and 1974. Older one is on it's second picture tube, but both
work. Now they're relegated to the old 8-bit atari computer and atari
2600 game machinces, as well as our not-that-old younger sister's
Nintendo game machine. Sony doesn't make TV's like they used to
though, the newer Mexican assembly-line TV's are not that reliable or
sharp anymore... Dad also just got a 35"" direct-view Sony (god, the
thing weighs a ton!). :)  Still, where would we be without Trinitrons,
CD players, or the veritable Walkman????

Put me down for a PB100 4/20 with ext. floppy, AppleTalk Remote Acces,
AC adapter, and fresh out of box (was used, but buyer switched to 140
on arrival and sold unopened box. Purchased last October for $925.
Later I bought a used PowerPort V.32 9600 bps internal fax-modem for
something like $225, I'm using right now! Works great!  :)

No real complaints. I love my portable system (got a color home setup
also. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other
simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or
overnight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modem
to do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to my
little sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System
7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal
emulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that it
benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx).
So, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not
too hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!!

(By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the
TA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license and
take-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No pirating
there, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! )

Just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never

I've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number
of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily
and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost
every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari
ST simply ""blow the Mac out of the water"" in terms of performance. At this time
I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the
advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would
get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in
muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((

I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well
someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the
speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.

As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems
almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be
faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a
graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the
Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc...

Re: Methods for attaching heat sink to processor.

Go to Radio Shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. It comes
in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  At
Radio Shack, it's catalog number 276-1372.  It's a mix of
silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  Plus, it's
tacky.

Usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then
bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your Mac, gravity
and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold
things in place.  Just make sure you remember it's in there, in case
you tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  You
wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac.

Actually, the 295 is for the 33 MHz PowerCard, not the Universal Powercache.
The 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about
$500 (still not a bad deal).  I believe the Powercard is one generation 
older than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that
the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many
Macs with the proper adaptor.  Both cards are 68030 based.

I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise 
different from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).

I would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these
Powercards were going very fast.

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't
be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds
to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty. Before it gets empty.

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even
under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V
documentation.

You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel (with the related
slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't
work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be
because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit
the sound and remove that command, then when you create your
channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you
are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.

Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the
sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses
it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you
can too.

One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the
Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not
sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your
sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the
Sound Manager.

I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments

(namely a PB170).  What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I  
primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with  
analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of  
numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice

According to MacWeek of 2-22-93:

The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra
800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris
610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit
digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,
the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,
with 256 gray levels, on the screen.

Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera
is expected to cost between $150 and $250.

The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's
Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have
to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.

The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility
called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by
applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.

The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support
for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an
FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will
require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.
Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the
Cyclone's.

not respond although all other functions were fine.

I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin

With the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:

With the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion
of boot cycle an alert displays ""The disk is unreadable - do you
want to eject it?"". For every combination of response, the alert 
reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The
FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable
of ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether
there is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external 
connector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.

With the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great 
(MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows
no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.

Now, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external
drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when
connected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16
(after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 
(with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows:

	PIN	Volts	PIN	Volts
	1	-	2	5
	3	-	4	5
	5	-	6	5
	7	-	8	-
	9	-	10	5
	11	-	12	-
	13	10.75	14	5
	15	10.75	16	5
	17	10.75	18	-
	19	10.75	20	5

This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests. I have tested all
diodes and pica fuses and can find no problems. Does anybody have any
ideas ?

Hi!

I want to change the default paper cassette on our LaserWriter Pro 630
from the 250-sheet cassette to the 500-sheet cassette. Right now, we all
have to change it manually on the Print dialog each time we print. If we
forget, the document is printed on the letterhead paper we have in the
250-sheet cassette.

Any ideas?

Just use a thin film of epoxy.  That!s what I did.  Epoxy conducts heat
fairly well.  And my heat sink gets warm to prove it.  I looked for the

The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
the power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on
your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it
cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles
of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics
are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact
portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my
computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it
off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the
phosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in
the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue
life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular
architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :"")

My question is this;

Is there a good (Cheap) way to hook up two monitors to my LC

OK, if I post where this comes from, will people stop sending email

The deal is from ""International Computer and Networking"" in CA.
(I saw the ad int he back of MacWorld and MacUser)...
phone number is 310-441-9181 and the deal may have changed since
a few weeks ago, since they change prices about every ten minutes ;-)

Alas, this is a funny system, it SOUNDS like a good deal, but this is a 
Centris 650, 4MB (on the motherboard) 4MB SIMM, 80MB HD, NO ETHERNET
and NO COPROCESSOR (well, actually it's a 68LC040 instead of a 68RC040,
'just had to say that to keep people from saying ""there is no such thing
as an '040 without a coprocessor, since the FPU is built into the chip"")

OK, there ya have it, but if I were you, I would wait untill the cyclones

However, the printed version is coming out ugly!  

Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer?  Or are

I will appreciate any suggestions.

As a side note, in that same ad (MacWorld 6/93), they are selling the 50MHz
Powercache for the IIsi with FPU for $575. For those thinking of upgrading
to the 040 33 MHz Turbo (an upgrade costs $600 direct from Daystar), this comes
out to $1175, about $200 cheaper than what most mail-order companies charge.

This happens intermittently to Macs in our department, ranging from IIsi's
to a Quadra 950.

I can end the slowdown immediately by unplugging the Ethernet cable from
the Mac. It seems that something on the network puts out these packet
storms every few days. These storms have the effect of making our Macs
slow down to a crawl.

    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially
if you have a large (16"" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do
is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my
office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor's tube.

>Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.

    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office
has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any
problems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off
when I'm not actually working on the server itself.)

Close, but no cigar.  The LISA was introduced in January, 1983 (at the

  So I finally decided to risk this upgrade, FAQ in hand I've gathered the
pieces together.  The only problem is that I haven't been able to find
anyone who's even heard of thermal tape/glue (which is what the FAQ
recommends for attaching the heat sink)  I am just tempted to use duct
tape here.... anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
the processor??  much thanks.

 I know of several NuBus frame-grabber boards but wonder if there
 might be similar ones for the lesser Macs (those without slots),
 something permitting instant freezing of a video picture (PAL) 
 and feeding it in without jaggies to a simple digitizer like 
 MacVision (which takes 22 secs to scan a picture, so a frame
 grabber is a necessity). 

 The objective is 512*342 1bit/ pixel (B/W) pictures stored in
 HyperCard... have tried using top-quality VCR with freeze-frame
 function but the screens come out full of streaks and garbage.

There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement.  True,
there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but
the internal power supply is well-protected. (I've turned my Mac on and off 
six or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is
the same.  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much
as a television, possibly more.

Turn it off when you're not using it.  It'll save you money and the world
a few more resources.

Hello,

I saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as I could tell no

I haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard
with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an
external keyboard. But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it?

Any help gratefully recieved. I will summarise to the net if necessary.

The only way to do that would be to add a video card to the LC expansion

Hello Net.People,

We have a LaserWriter Select 310 (standard 1.5Mb RAM) connected to an LC

The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type 1 fonts or any TrueType fonts

The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct

Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printer/configuration,
because we really need some help on this one.

Subject: Quadra Clock Modification - Long
Summary: Quadra 700 Clock Acceleration Instructions
Keywords: Quadra,clock,acceleration,oscillator
Article-I.D.: shelley.1r577lINNjks
Organization: University of Washington
Lines: 149
NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu

Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I
had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU
but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.

Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted
before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.
I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher
speeds.

Parts

	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of
	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the
	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend
	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.

	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for
	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:

		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)
		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)
		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)

	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.

	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a
	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)
	   
	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as
	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins
	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.

	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a 
	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had
	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which
	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up 
	   something similar or risk frying your CPU.
	   
Procedure

1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.

2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from
	the back of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic
    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,
	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.
	
9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.
	
10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of
    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic
	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The
	motherboard then comes directly out.
	
11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the
    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators
	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.
	
	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of
	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure
	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.
	
	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is
	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is
	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without
	proper care.
	
12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.

13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the
	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the
	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new
	50 mhz clock.
	
14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.
	
14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.

15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.
	
16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

18) Replace the phillips head screw

19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.

21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn 
    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,
	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your
	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.
	
	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and
	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and
	be astounded. 
	
	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up
	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since
	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single
	problem.
	
Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real
risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than
$50 in parts.

than a month old and the MultiTech modem sells for about $440 or so.

MultiTech Multimodem II (9600 data/fax)
U.S. Robotics Sportster (9600 data)
Microcom QX/12K         (normally will connect at only 2400 as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom)

The USR and the MultiTech are both brand-new

Subject: IIsi clock Poll Results - Long
Organization: University of Washington
Lines: 161
NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu
Summary: Results of IIsi clock modification poll
Keywords: IIsi,clock,poll

This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24
machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.
This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.

Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. 


Issues:

	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use
		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple
		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to
		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place
	
		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.
		
		Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,
			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds.
			
	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was
		repaired and the machine is operational. One other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.
		
		No reports of static discharge damage.
		
		No reports of high speed operation causing damage.
		
		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes.
		
	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus
		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with
		success. See case histories
		
	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.
		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some
		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.
		
		
		
Case Histories:

I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external

were back ordered until May 8.  I placed an order anyways and two days later
I had a visit from Federal Express.  Well, you can guess how I spent my weekend.
Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange
when you order from the Apple Catalog.  You may want to check if they have any
internal drives.

BTW, an older version of GateKeeper (I don't recall which version), hung up my
Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk.  I got the newer version
which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4.xx CD driver.

My recently modified Quadra 700 with a socket for clock oscillators has now
completed nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz (with a 64 mhz
clock oscillator). I have also tried a 55 mhz CMOS clock and that works as well.
On the more stupid side, I've discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make
your Q700 as slow as a Centris 610. However, a 25 mhz clock which would have
yielded a 12.5 mhz Quadra 700 (Who'd want one?) didn't work at all.

The code should be in C Pascal or Modula. The code will be used on several

Hi,
I'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work.  I'm using
Retrospect 1.3Ci,
and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci,
which has
now unfortunately gone to another department.
  Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup.  I can't seem to
get the
Retrospect software to recognize the media at all.  When in the ""Devices""
dialog,
it can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly
'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'.  This does not
happen with the
Mac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready'.
  I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
solution... I 
know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra,
but they have
a Mac IIci which they can use!
  
THE SYMPTOMS
System software is 7.1, also didn't
work with 7.0.1
  I have tried the following:
  Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI (required)
  Tested on a variety of machines:  Quadra, IIsi, and LC (at least).
  Connected no other SCSI devices
  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc.
  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one (Yes!  we got that desperate!)
  Read the Retrospect manual (EVEN MORE DESPERATE :))

Replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. 
I'll post any
solutions to this group.

Cheers,
Matt.

I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that,
but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems. 

But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!

Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz.

Very interesting are the graphics results (Graphics 30.052) couldn't belief this, but it is true. Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F).

Besides the faster processor, the 950 has SCSI 2, and as far as I know, faster
I/O due to separate processors handling those functions. The 950 can output 16
bit video to a 16"" monitor with 1 meg of VRAM and 24 bit with 2 meg.

Subject: Problems with Laserwriter print driver and Printmonitor
Organization: EDC
Lines: 17

We are having problems with our Laserwriter print drivers going bad on
various people's machines on our Appletalk network.  On our network, people
have 7.0, 7.01, and 7.1 versions of the Laserwriter print driver.  We have
been solving the problem by reinstalling the print driver, but it is
time-consuming and a real pain.

The Printmonitor software also seems to go bad frequently.  We have also
just been replacing it (over and over, it seems) to keep things running.

Does anyone out there have any ideas about what may be causing the printing
software to go bad?  Are there known INIT conflicts or network conflicts? 
I would appreciate communication about any similar experiences you may have
had or ideas you have.

You could send me an email directly to: karens@edc.org....

Has anybody tried running these higher resolutions??

Somewhere I thought I read that the 1152x870 on a 17"" monitor may make the

	For what it's worth, my experience has been that the educational
discount (which my S.O. has taken advantage of, as a teacher) is roughly
equivalent to the corporate discounts that I'm able to get as an employee of
a fairly large multi-state corporation, which is usually at least as good as
what one can get at one of the ""discount"" computer chains (e.g. CompUSA).
	For purposes of budget estimation around here, we usually just knock
around 20% off SRP.

I vote for turning them off at night.  THe stress of off/on is a little 
harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but
turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea.

The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along
with heat. 

We have a lot of 10-year old machines in the basement that still work, but
who cares? (they are off 24 hours a day).

	I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time.  This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the
same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off
screens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning
the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)
the machine is still available over the network.

	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.
Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody
pinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody
logs in via a telnet connection.

	I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter
months; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be as
efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's
not too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.  Not only are you
wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to
get rid of the waste heat.

Well, I don't exaclty know what _should_ be done, but what I do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use.  I do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though.  Turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less RAM than
a screen saver (but it requires more of MY memory to remember to turn
it off... pretty easy to remember to turn it on though :-)

    Not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. The C610
isn't like the IIsi was, meaning that the motherboard of the C610 is 
actually designeds to run at the speed of the CPU, and not designed to
run at a higher speed (like 25MHz) but be forced to run at the speed of
a slower CPU (20MHz).

    There is more than one oscillator. If you are talking about the CPU
oscillator chip, I think that it is located under the socket for the
'040. At least this is what I have read in some other posts in this

I believe that Apple, Sun and a number of other desktop machine
manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate
power-saving techniques;  this is also something that governments in
other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see
it.  This may include the ability for the system to fully power down
the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on
automatically.  (Is this a ""sell"" on screen saver software companies?)

Goals for ""idle"" power consumption have been set at something like 30
watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on
this).

Note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,
especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.
Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for
the night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per
year.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would
probably have greater than double that value.

Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and
home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),
building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to
cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.

BTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving
work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front.  There was some indication that
monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
lots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but
might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back.

**************************

    having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes.  at
least for the 600x400 configuration.  you can get an adaptor called Mac
VGA -Q from James engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you
display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable.  I think the
800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync.  I use this on my sony 1604. 
(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB 
SIMMs are.  72-pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting 
the use of 4 Mb DRAM devices (the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs) to be used 
for two 4 MB banks on one SIMM.  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper 
to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and 
exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  
It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - 
this could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do 
this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a 
single-bank composite one.

Apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor
design that does just that.  It was announced along with the new

in the buildings where I work, gigawatts are wasted by unused, always-on

	Performa 200 == Classic II
	Performa 400 == LC II
	Performa 4xx == LC III
	Performa 600 == well, nothing :)

	The Performas are made to be low-cost business solutions.  The 4xx have
bundled software, modems, etc.
	Because they have no ""retail price"" you might be able to get a steeper
discount on them.  Shop around.

	As far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.  Much cheaper.

First of all, I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Apple.  They'll
treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal
opinion).

The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates with
Apple's rates.  I don't know Apple's video scanning rates, but I use the
Micron Xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation.

About cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get a
few Mac-VGA cables and try them out.  I have a ViewSonic 5E (14"") and I
use an NEC adaptor.  Other monitors may use other adaptors.  I also have
a Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an
Apple 16"".  I need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it
works fairly well.

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally?

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

This is probably not a ""newer"" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

Just curious.....

Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW-3.1 go where
and for what purpose?  What can be left out, for instance, if
you don't want to do background printing?

As far as I can remember, all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and
printing using the 3.1 driver is to drag the driver itself (either serial or
appletalk depending on your needs) to the system folder. You don't need the
fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward, bare bones, basic
printing....I don't have anything else installed and can still print on a
Deskwriter using sys7.1 and HP driver 3.1

Hi everyone,
      I'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing
on the HP Deskwriter (Sys 7.1, Deskwriter driver 3.1, PowerBook 170).
When I print from, say, MS Word, I see the message ""Spooling to disk,""
but sometimes nothing prints. Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus,
I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. It
seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its
status as ""Multifinder NOT aware"" allows it to do this without my being
informed by a message such as ""HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly."" Have
you ever seen this problem before.
        There may or may not be a related problem. I have experienced
problems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing ""sleep"" from the
Finder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory
map, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted
reloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as
usual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing
my machine from going to sleep?
	Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase of
a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software. 

	Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net.
	Yours truly,
	Marc Bizer

Actually, the Quadra 900 and 950 both have the same SCSI controller,            (running at different speed).  They are not SCSI 2, but can support
certain SCSI commands that take advantage of faster drives.  The
I/O processors are present on both machines.  The Q950 runs its
I/O bus at 25MHz, while the 900's I/O bus is 16MHz.

The Quadra 950 supports 16bit color on all monitor sizes, as well
as 24bit up to 832 x 624 resolution.  It also supports 1024 x768
resolution.  The 900 supports supports 8bit at 1152 x 870, and
does not support 1024 x 768 at all.

VRAM on the 950 is 80ns or faster, and 100ns or faster on the 900.

I guess he is right. Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either,

Very easy. If you boot without the MODE32 control panel, then it will
disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. So when
you run OK you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. Check About this Macintosh
and see if you havce a 12+MB system.

    Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI
chip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2
modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI
performance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O
controller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.

 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS. I recently ordered
 an external Quantum 240. The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the
 order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted. 

 Installing the drive was simple; I didn't even have to read the manual. The
 SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. I daisy-chained the drive
 from my Syquest (also from APS) and booted up with no problems. 

 I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. It's a
 pretty good assortment.

 The drive/fan is a bit noisier than I would like, but I think it'll be OK.
 The speed seems very good, although I haven't run any objective tests. It
 also seems to spin up pretty quickly; I can hit the power switch for it, and
 almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive.

 Some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older
 Syquest case is metal. There is one LED, which is normally green, and
 flickers red as the drive is accessed.

 Just a data point,

 This is a pet peeve of mine. I wish companies would put power switches on the
 front of the equipment! If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front, I
 would happily power it off at night. Almost every piece of computer equipment
 I own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and
 modems--why?). I hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon.

Subject: When you're not using it, turn it off!

Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United
States' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not
actively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running
at night and on weekends.

Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use
of electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF
when you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.

Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the
computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-
efficient PCs that ""power down"" automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These
new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and
New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual
electricity bills.  Look for the special EPA ""Energy Star"" logo when
you buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.

According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2
emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million
automobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants
responsible for acid rain.

Please do your part ... be responsible.  If you're not using it,
then just TURN IT OFF.

using the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who

question is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the
power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my 
Quadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which
allows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the
socket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow
him to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he
purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?

Subject: Where to get power cord to plug Non-Apple monitor into Quadra power supply?
Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lines: 23
NNTP-Posting-Host: alfredo.mit.edu

I have a Sony 1304s whch I would like to hook up so that I get its 
power though my Quadra 800's power supply. ie, if I had an apple monitor,
I could plug the monitor directly into the computer so that when I hit
the power button the keyboard, both the monitor and computer go on, and
when I shut down, both go off.  Is there an extension cord type cable
I can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug
this ""extension cable"" into my Quadra?

Any thoughts and comments would be appreciated,

Thanks in advance,

	Maybe you should contact your schools officials and make 
them consider installing the necessary softwares or hardwares that
allows the Unix works stations to shuts off its monitor when 
left untouched.  It does save a lot of energy.

In-Reply-To: <C5wxqG.H93@news.claremont.edu>

    THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:

    The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga
monitor with a centris (hence title).  

    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any
old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a
Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.

    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.
 The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my
1604s).

THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would
advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As
to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN
CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU
TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND
THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.

personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits
(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video card).(i.e. ""well you can get a resolution
1168x832 on this $5,  9"" ""super smelly sock"" monitor that will let you
display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably
priced ""oder eater"" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz
vertical."")



Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch.

                                                                    -A.

Hi-
Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  
Apple uses in the powerbook Duos?  Or in the powerbook in general?

What are the factors that make the Duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop  
machine running the same processor at the same speed (25MHz 68030)?  How many  
wait states are in the memory system, etc?  What kind of a data bus does it  
use?  32-bit or 16-bit?  

It's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock.

Anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when  
making notebooks?  I heard of a 486DX2/66 notebook getting a ""whopping"" 10  
MIPS rating.  A similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that,

Subject: Quadra 950 marginal video?
Summary: sync problems on multiple boards
Nntp-Posting-Host: merlin.cvs.rochester.edu
Organization: University of Rochester, Rochester NY
Lines: 61

We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of
techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-)
This Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb
I think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the
Mac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video
circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,
even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's
pretty hard to hit menu items ;-)
We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem
has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has
varied. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the
cache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not
obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU
right?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did
not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have
has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,
but did it twice within an hour yesterday).
The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty
sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had
previously tried ourselves anyway). These included:
-swapping the RAM
-swapping the VRAM
-swapping monitors (3 different 13"" Apple RGB and 2 16"" Apple RGB)
-swapping cables
-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy
-sacrificing various small mammals
Here are some other facts:
-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed
 (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)
-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards
 that exhibit it in our lab
-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards
 that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as
 faulty according to us.
Here are some speculations:
-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that
 much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do
 with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can
 reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).
-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our
 walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We
 have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in
 the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do
 not want to believe it.
-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past
 security at the entrance to our site.

Has anyone any ideas? Please? Please email as well as posting cause I seem
to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less
time available to read news! :-)

No.  I recently bought an LC II with a 14"" monitor.  The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs.  Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets, there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor.  But it was in the computer box, not the monitor box.  It's
not as if the cables are particularly expensive, though.  $10-$15 at the
most.

From what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only 16MHz, to be
compatible with the old LC style boards, while the FPU socket close to
the CPU is clocked at 25MHz.

I guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a 25MHz clock from the
extended PDS socket...

There are two approaches:

1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer.

Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking
for some special thing at a Mac store.

PSI makes an internal fax modem for the map portable (1-800-622-1722) but 
asks too much for it (retail $450). I'd buy an external and save about 
$350. 

there is a manufacturer that still makes INTERNAL HD's for the portable, 
they're listed in some of the catalog ""magazines"" for apple stuff you can 
find at bookstores. If I see it again I'll post it. But, again, you might 
want to just add a small lightweight external HD built for the 
powerbooks. You'd be able to use it with a new computer some day. Any 
other mac portable questions, I'll have to cry uncle.

Don't blame me. I voted for XXXXXXX.

Don't be silly.

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well, but using SM on
any of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action
game since it just steals too much time from the CPU. This is
a fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is
possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for
a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using
the SM, pray tell?

The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can
carry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly
to the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the
politically correct thing, but from the developers' point of
view it is.

	I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC. The card
	is manufactured by Asante. On it i can read:
	""Asante Tech, inc. Copyright 1991. MACCON + LC REV.B"".
	The card has an fpu socket on it. It provides thin Ethernet connector
	and there's another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors.

	My questions are:
	- Will this card work on any other model than LC-serie ?, given that
	it's a PDS card, will it work with the IIsi PDS slot ?. I think there
	may be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots.

	- What's that other conncetor on the card ?.

	_ Is anyone interested in it ?. I can ship it to any CEE country.

Saying things like that incline one to believe that you can't get it (SCSI)
to work for your setup (too bad). I've daisy-chained 4 SCSI devices off my
mac without a problem (limit is 7 SCSI devices in the daisy-chain). If it
isn't working for you, it's really better to state the problem (unless all
you really intend to do is try to get nasty e-mail, in that case perhaps you
would be better off posting to alt.masochistic type of newsgroup).

A similar reason is why people at work, used to seeing SCO unix running
on a 486, are suprised when they see my Sun-3 at home running faster w/a 16MHz
68020/68881.  The Sun was designed from the ground up for UNIX, the PC
wasn't.

This is why you need a gargantuan processor to run Windows.  The basic
design of the box is all wrong. (Would've been better if MS had put most
of Windows on a plug-in ROM card from day one. (priced at $24.95 or
so...) People woulda loved it.

Apple had the right idea, just stumbled a bit in the execution.

Are you sure it's not a problem caused by software?  I've seen this sort 
of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT 
conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video 
hardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the 
Q950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to 
24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - 
it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed 
then.

Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like 
QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some 
of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.

I've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is NOT a
result of the 8/24GC board! Try Zapping the PRAM by holding down
""Command-Option-P-R"" durring startup! You will have to reset everything to

    The Performas are made to be low-cost, widely distributed (sold at
Sears) home machines, not business machines. They were developed to
compete with the retail outlet home computer market.

    Sears is probably going to have the best price around, most of the
time, based on the number they can purchase and stuff like that.

    Not really. The newer Peformas (405, 430, 450) come with what is
really a third party monitor that Apple has put their name on and
called it the Performa Plus display. Essentially it is a VGA monitor,
quite cheap.

You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi's power supply is not rated to
handle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained
about it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost
computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end
computer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video
board.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop
one later.

    Ah... Ok. I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple
division other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the
one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and
configurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally
assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At
least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple
divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if
they feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all
the time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different name
to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it.

I'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for
the power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc.,
etc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any
controls/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is
because the designers put them there deliberately.

The real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or
maliciousness.

Larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent
bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput.  They also
have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and
reduced seek times (due to reduction of rotational latency.)

It probably won't work with any other LC.  The ones I have for the LC II
are Rev. D.  No, it won't work in the IIsi's PDS slot since it's a 68030
PDS, while the LC has the 68020 PDS.  The IIsi and SE/30 share the same
kind of card.

That's the 10BaseT ethernet connector.

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup.

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose. Next time you power down the computer, check that all cables are on tight.

Sorry for the delay in replying; your message only showed up today (23 Apr)
on apple.com. QuickDraw GX is not a replacement for QuickDraw; the two of
them live quite happily together. You may write an app that only uses GX

Murry,

They can read high density disks (1.4 MB) as well as flopticals (21 MB).  The

Double speed performance from a CD drive does not require SCSI-2 interfacing.
The resultant 300 kbps speed is well within the transfer rate of an LC. In

No, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing.  Its just  
that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  
when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  
read and display them.  Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data (excluding  
sound) at around double the speed.

> 3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150.
 
CD150 is not multisession capable.  This means that you lose the ability to add  
any more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD).  Finally, since the  
CD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer  
data (excluding sound).

A rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so

they have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610.
He didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the

It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems

He's not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says to
consider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend a
IIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.)

This is completely false.

This is also false. What you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability -- which is based on the firmware and
electronics, not the drive speed. I'll admit, though, that I have
not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed.

>3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150.

The above (1 & 2), proves 3 to be false.

>Any comments?

The Apple CD300 is an excellent double-speed multi-session PhotoCD
capable drive. So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba
XM3401. Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a
bargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies
(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime
player in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC
CDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac
sells it for around $619.

>Thanx.

Your welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the
mailorder info does you little good, I guess. If not:
Spin Peripherals -- 800-466-1200
Club Mac         -- 800-258-2622
Relax Tech       -- 510-471-6112

Nothing wrong with the Apple, though, which is based on a Sony
mechanism and speed-identical to the NEC. The Toshiba's speed
advantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)
and 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).

Good luck,

My 610 is working great.  I haven't heard of any problems.  Sounds
to me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talking about.  It's
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis
of problems with one machine.  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII
doesn't make a lot of sense either.  If this person is so convinced the 610
is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming
it's a problem with all of them?

  Your source is wrong.  The double speed CD300 is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk.  The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the
CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless
you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.

  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster
reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,
but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.

A lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial  
interest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed  
to factual information, etc.).  What it sounds like to me is that this guy  
has had an experience with one flaky Centris 610 and formed an  
all-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's.  I've seen lots of  
people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any  
other Mac Xyz would be any good, since their experience (with >one<  
machine) with a Mac Xyz had been bad.  Their loss, eh?

In my quest for speed, I've run into a problem. 66.66 mhz and 80 mhz
clock oscillators are available but I haven't found any speeds between
66.66 and 70 mhz for further testing. Fox Electronics (813) 693-0099 can make custom oscillators but if anyone knows a source cheaper than $12/osc please
let me know. Some 68 and 70 mhz units would complete my speed trials on the
old Q700

   Huh?  Where did you get this idea from?  I think you got this
backwards.  The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5
cycles I believe).  Things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duo
doesn't have undocked).  Extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too.  Real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen
depth you are running etc.

PS!  The Duo is 32-bit through-out.

It is just extra wire and work to put the switch in front. Usually the easiest

It's made by (SURPRISE) National Instruments:
6504 Bridge Point Parkway
Austin, TX 78730-5039
(800) 433-3488
anonymouse ftp at: ftp.natinst.com

Their 1991 catalog lists the NB-8G as follows:

fetch and deposit DMA controller (8 channels)
IEEE-488 interface with data rates up to 850 kB/sec, with DMA and
programmed I/O
   transfers
8 16-bit counter timer channels
RTSI bus (that's the connector on the top of the board - it links it with
   other National Instrument boards
List price of $1295

The board isn't in later catalogs: it has been superceeded by the

My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have

is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
works with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and

Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so
much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.
Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business
application. 

What do you mean by 'no ""retail price""'.  Quite the contrary, I think.
The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,
IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling
required.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One
price, medium performance, ready to go.

When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears
(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and
Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I
suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know
didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with...

If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.
I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple
Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that
decision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out
with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.

Nope.  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a
usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)
and receives all my faxes.

I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heat
than I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I've
got one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I just
flip the switch in front when I start or stop working.

By the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since
their new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
length of idle time.

	OK...here is my question.  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 to
a SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBook/DOS Companion.  Can
anyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them?  If there is such
a cable, can I purchase it from MacWharehouse or some computer store?
If I must buy the cable from James Engineering, how much do they run and
how can I get a hold them???  I guess that was more than 'a' question.  :)
Thanks in advance for any replys.

The first problem was the sound.  I tried the M0, but then even the logon was
muted.  I don't want that.  Any other suggestions for that hissing?

The second is really strange.  First, I kept mentioning that FC slowed down
all the time and took too long.  Well I just logged on with extensions off and
I didn't have any slowdown.  Also, last time I was online I quit (which
usually disconnects and quits).  It disconnected but it wouldn't quit.  I had
to force quit, and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in
use.  This is really strange.  I thought it might have to do with fax
software.  Or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely
explanation).  So, any suggestions?

this is a bad idea. my machine is on 24 hours a day, but it's actually

incompatible with the 040's processor cache, so I have to run with it turned off.
Actually, the main thing I don't like it is that it doesn't have a software
powerup/powerdown, and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE!  (I
haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night I'm going

  I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I (the original!).
Have you tried cleaning the print heads? With the SWII driver, it's
and option in the Print dialog box. Sometimes I had to do it several
times to get the crud out. Yes it wastes ink, but it beats those
white annoying lines.
  Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big
black box. It can help to get the ink flowing.
  Good luck!

Interesting delema for all those out there.
My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio
100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the
deal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a
disection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow
drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know
NADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I
wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing
list?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.
Ok here it goes:

	We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms
offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price
and reliability, the second being VERY important.
	How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you
think?
	Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard
(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time
great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is
just a reliable?  Price?
	Printers:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the
Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit
access so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in
terms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) 
Price? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or
such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is
the Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. 
Suggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through
and they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy
to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).
	Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting
these things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the
net, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be
astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask
them?
	Little more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot
about macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the
time to go and look for all of this stuff. So I am hoping the collective
resources and intelect of the net can help (Has before) [Shameless plug: BUY

Nntp-Posting-Host: mac183.mech.nwu.edu
Organization: Mechanical Engineering
Lines: 32

In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's

1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm
Both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed
by different people. 

Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the
Memory Chimes.  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen
and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  In
both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it
back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my
marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are
""lopsided"" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after
time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the
keyboard or something?  

Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you
could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.

I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a
2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution.

Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.

I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices
have yet to be worked out, so I'm just thinking right now
about their merits and drawbacks.

Here's what I've thought of:

The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and
greater memory capacity.

The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci
""32-bit clean""?), and would have sound input.  I also like the
""pizza-box"" case.

Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the
LC III being a little slower.

Yes, the IIci has 32-bit clean ROMs.
 
Either model would be a good choice.  Another option: get a ""new"" IIci
from a dealer that hasn't sold out yet.  Also, don't forget the Performa
405 which, I believe, is the same as an LC-III but may be packaged with
more goodies for a better price.

How important is this? How many NuBus cards do you have/plan to
acquire? How much memory do you really need? I've got a ci, and
20mb of ram. That's plenty. I also have a 24bit graphics card
on the NuBus - I'm a sucker for pretty pictures...I think the
LCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can
not have. At least, not out of the box.

The ci is 32-bit clean. I solved the sound input problem with
a MacRecorder. But that's gotten to be a fairly expensive
solution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder.

The actual difference is probably not worth worrying over.

Depends on the price you can get the ci for. Educationally speaking,
the 4/80 [?] LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under $1300. Add
in roughly $500 for a monitor. Last I'd heard, an 8mb LCIII simm
went for ~$250. 

I think you're in a win-win situation. No matter what you decide,
you'll most likely be happy with it.

According to what I saw in a store today, the Performa 405 is not the same
as an LCIII.  It only has a 16Mhz 68030 while the LCIII has a 25Mhz 030.
Correct me if I am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have
forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer.
Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge
about Macs as I do about DOS machines.

If so, can the buttons be programed to say, cut, paste etc?

Can anyone suggest a supplier?

The only 3 button mice I know exist are:

	1. Logitek	$106.00 Aust (Injan ).
	2. Anorus	$100.00 Aust (Mac direct).
Are these ok for the above configuration?

I am using a NEC 4FG with my Centris 610. The cable adapter was provided by
NEC (you have to call to get this free adapter). I am also sharing it with my
486 (using a switch box and extra cables).

My questions: 

	How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed?
	Or how do you change the mode(resolution)? 
	Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW?

I am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display
1028x768(?) with my 486.

My telephone line seems pretty stable and I have the Supra as well.  Works

out.  Zoom is out of the question from what I'm hearing.  AT&T has a great

If you want to receive a fax, your computer will have to be on, but not 
the monitor and of course the modem.  You can set the number of rings that 
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software.  
It's entirely up to you how to arrange that.  I've had faxes sent to me 
which is great but I've been home to set it.  I don't have a need to set 
fax receiving up all day.  Also I hear there is a device that can channel 
all incoming phone signals for about $70.  Rumor also that the phone 
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what 
you need.

Best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback.

I don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the Mac Superdrive can  
read MS-DOS disks (can it??) then you can transfer files between the NeXT and  
a Mac by using MS-DOS formatted disks since the NeXT *can* read/write that  
format.  And if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it  
over the serial port using kermit.

Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this?

The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac,
but rather, any of various workstations that use the
68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs.  I used to own a NeXT
68030 cube.   

But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an
extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after
installing system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU
power? 

Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  I
have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editing
relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several
seconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with power
cycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infested
feces. 
I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing.

All of those things that you've mention can still be accomplished
when the
machine is ""power down.""  When the previous poster said ""power
down"", it 
doesn't mean turning off the machine, it just means that the machine
is
in an energy conserving mode that sucks up least electricity.

I've had my C610 for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever.
It's been ""customized"" with---

 * replaced the Apple-Quantum 80 drive with a Connor 212 drive.  

 * installed a Tandberg SCSI tape drive in the internal bay which works
   just fine (though Apple doesn't seem to be supplying front panel
   bezels w/ a standard 5.25"" cutout...).  

It's hooked up to an Apple LaserWriter Plus and has no printing
problems at all, tested printing complex Photoshop graphics.

It has expanded VRAM and extra 8 meg SIMM, no problems.

So in sum, I have no idea what this dealer is complaining about.

Here's the story:

(1)  The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output.  However...

(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch ""high resolution color
display""---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.

So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you
need (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the
VGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use
it's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over
the VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot
produce).

As far as (a) above is concerned, contact

 James Engineering, Inc.
 6329 Fairmount Ave.
 El Cerrito, CA  94530
 510-525-7350
 FAX: 510-525-5740

They can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*
want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to
have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want
an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style
connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.

As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of
67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,
the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and
a 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.

The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as
the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes
in the PC compatible world.

Good luck!

Yes, and one thing to think about is the pricing on the 160M harddrive 
configuration.  When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M
harddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space 
would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-
uartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and 
you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  

Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a
several-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files 
with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like 
os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are 
pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much
it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a 
useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though
I must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my 
computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to 
because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, 
softPC or trying any unix os!)

Subject: Re: Good APS experience
Organization: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, UCLA
Lines: 31

I thought I'd share a good experience, too.  I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero
footprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the
front panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my
SE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs
holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel
was coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation
until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a
network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me
some dead time during which to have the drive sent out).

I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the
tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --
though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my
modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm
never flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I
could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem
with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a
day (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under
warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class
insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed
Ex by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was
traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).

The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked
to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the
drive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered the
day I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little
seal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well.

Well,

    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory.
I work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds
of computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS.
Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed
I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or
designed the software.
    Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I
have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work.
The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I would
be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft
or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once
in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.
   
I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine
just crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if you
haven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or die
perogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED
with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity
people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.

Well, almost NuBUS 90 anyway, comprehensive bus contention between processors

However, I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself,
don't ask, Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard.

        Interesting, as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree.  I know of several people I work
with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have
a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  They also
didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local University either. :(
       I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice, than a truly specialty field.  It will be even more
so in the future.
       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field
of Software Engineering.  The difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon
unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides

Well, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are
in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out
of a Top 10 comp sci school.

The trick is, to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the
rest of your education...TRUST ME its the best way to go..even
if you don't get a TOP salary.  Which I have always been a poor

from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I

I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use 
system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't

Hi.

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on, and the only one

that the check ""Allow owner to see entire disk"" should be enabled too).

A bad thing: you can't eject the disk until FS is turned off.

Hey All-

We have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab.  It had  
given us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  
has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  
aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics ""SIMMer"").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  
through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  
rectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  
to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  
26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  
down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  
could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  
that we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  
none of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  
it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI  
upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board?  The drive seems to spin up  
all right and unpark itself upon powerup.  The events are too coincidental to  
attribute the problem to stiction.

featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who

I shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me

I have a question for y'all:

I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5"" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis
in the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions
in IBM PC magazines)

Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,
but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,
*max*.

How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it
had to have a DTR of 10megs a second?

(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.
I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data
at 5megs a second!)

Thank you.

A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra 900 (maybe 950) with 
all but one NuBus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video
card.  He reports 8 bit video is too slow for good real-time display of
what he needs to see.  He also reports that the built-in video is even
worse.  He's not a Mac guru, and I haven't seen the system, so this is
about all I know.

I suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might
come from a switch to an accelerated PDS slot video card.  Does this
sound right?  Who makes a PDS accelerated video card for the Quadra thats
worth looking at?  Any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance!

Sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the IIvx's he has in
stock.  I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that 
 1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.
 2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper.
So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people
that IIvx's are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all
his old stock!

No disrespect to dealers or the IIvx intended!

wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from
other things (garbage disposal, etc.)  Here are my questions:
 
How much harm do voltage fluctuations cause?  My computer does not
share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a
refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose
doesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything.  All
these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer,
right?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different
speeds.  Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it
or to leave it on?
 
How much electricity does my computer use?  I have an Apple IIgs (ne
flames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside),
an AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5"" HD (1 fan and its own
P/S).  How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours?  Also, how much
of this is used by the monitor?
 
Does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is
totally black but still on?
 
Many computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power.  I
always thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of
leaving the computer on in the first place (except portables).  Is
this true?

Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed
circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your
IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in
the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle
is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide
positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:
look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On
all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin
is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard
for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins
39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep
the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the
cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the
pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But
beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables
with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors
this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide
which side is pin 1.

It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives
are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you
should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the
drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper
selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the 
docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have
one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like
yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't
have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice
help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be
able to help you).

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a ""physical layer"" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.  But it is strictly software.

Yep.  I've done this, too.  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
down on the ""latch"" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  Label
each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled
them out.  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals
to get the correct orientation.

Hello,

I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't

The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best
keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,
etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone?

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins &
electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. 
Maybe the communication protocol is different? 

Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.
In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.

Thanks,

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

I have a new monitor which I set up approximately 3-4 feet from

Is this safe for the monitor, or will/can the EMF emitted by the AC current eventually affect my monitor?  If so, how, and is the

 A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't
about a so-called Videostreamer. This is an interface
between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for
backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?)
claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think)

My question is:
 Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes 
 REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite
 unbelievable to me). 

However, any comments on the interface are appreciated.
Please mail your replies directly to me, I will sum up
if neccesary. Thanks in advance...

Well, I tried this method based on responses from several people.  Either
I am a klutz(probable) or they have changed the connector.  I ended up having
to destroy the connector, put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and 
then plug them into the SB connector in the correct order.  It works great 
this way so this turned out just fine.  It certainly sounded easy based on
other people's experiences but my attempts did not go too well...

I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs

installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested
the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a
parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as
also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels
are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe
recocnize them and tests them ok until first access).

special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the 
problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it
makes the system slow!

You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error
Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error
when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on
the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep
at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in
Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.

The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board
manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies
(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your
IDE controller, also.

Anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.

It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing!

I'm not sure about DOS, but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this


loop:
	is there anything to do?
		YES -> do it; goto loop
		NO  -> goto loop


The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...

IDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
If it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-
ification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is
probably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum.  Check those jumpers.

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design.
It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of
the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle,
the multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting,
microcode isn't microcoding, etc.  This means transistors aren't
switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means
less heat.\

From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the
CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power.

1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the

2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!

3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1
   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.

It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and
check out your system.

1) What do I gain with this new BIOS?

2) How can I save a copy of my old BIOS in case I want to go back?

3) How do I install the new BIOS?

a 286 upgrade would probably cost about $50, 386 about $150 or so.  
Coprocessors or accelerator cards would cost at least that much.

I am asked to design a video-aid system for teacher to show their students
how to work their way round in Windows.

I have seen people using video projector, TV set and large size monitor as
thrir display for presentations. I am told that there are three ways to
connect to a video projector: composite, Y/C & RGB.

Can anyone explain to me the different between the three and the likely cost

Hello,

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version
with the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems:

1 ) I've lost the manual!!!

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when
    the network connection dies.

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)


    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't
know the Bboard number.

    If you can, please help me with as many of the following
as possible:

a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number
b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card
    (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)
c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get
    everything working.

    Any help at all would be much appreciated.

Interesting.  Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster

you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2
IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and 
1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have
a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC 
before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.
However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to
be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other 
controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).
just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.
Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to 
ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you 
have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
on.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.
Good Luck!

I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
modem. Any time I give the modem a reset command [ATZ] while, in windows.
The computer locks up. If I give the ATZ command in DOS, it will work. My solution 
was to not give the modem the [ATZ] command thru windows. In the PROCOMM +
install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. ATZ
was not included in the initialization string & it works fine. I called MS
about this, & they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict 
could be. The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ
command.

486DX2/66 is faster for this if you are using DOS. PC Mag reviewed a bunch

1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games.  After leaving F-15 III it
would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I
don't know what other corrections were made.

2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.

3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a
config.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files
explode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from
there.

I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5"") and ideally would like to

I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active

floppies with serialized access. I know that microchannel machines can keep 
more than one floppy active simultaneously. But does anyone have a controller 
for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going?
How about for an EISA machine?

If the limitation is a software limitation, I can work around that by using
OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286.

Our university is wanting to buy a couple of servers to provide Email

lokked at for one to provide news service and one mail service from a
proposed Internet connection. Are there any foreseable problems with
this proposed set up? Provided that IHETs is providing an Ethernet
line from a Cisco router into our network.

2 X 	486 DX 50 MHz

	Dual Duplexed 2.5Gb SCSI-2  
    	with 5yr parts and labor on everything but the hard drives
	running UNIVEL UNIX for Application Servers

We will run CC:Mail on a campus wide Novell network to access these
<hopefully>. Is there any other aspect I should be looking at?



Which NIC do I use? 
Is this enough disk space?
etc...

 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V,
8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only
COM1-3 are available.  I believe this is documented somewhere in the
system manuals, but I can't recall where.

I have a 486DX-33 ISA pc-compatible (Insight) with an Infotel internal

modem in, I pulled a phone out of the jack in another room, and ran a phone

worked fine.  Then I split the line from the jack in the other room, ran
the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer.  Then
I got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem.
Now when I try to use the modem, QuickLinkII says ""No dialtone"".  The phone
plugged into the back of the computer works fine.  I tried unplugging the
phone, but still no dice.  Is it that the phone line was split too many

: p.s.  I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or
: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)

I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-
modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,
but you should still check your software!

I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA
Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the
connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is
a ""DB-25"" but IBM has set an alternative ""standard"" of DB-9.  The primary
signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.
For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's
five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)
signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)
are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the ""connection"" has been established
i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh
there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

Name    DB-9     DB-25
 SG       5        7
 TD       3        2
 RD       2        3
DTR       4       20
DSR       6        6
DCD       1        8
RTS       7        4
CTS       8        5
 RI       9       22

Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE
to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232
signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,
and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-
ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the
serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-
Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also
fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And
that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the
DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the
DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow
control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,
one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no
wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract ""escape""
codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-
ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair
game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,
I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a
differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-
ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more
""gotcha"" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to
see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And
of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must
pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,
if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use
this one.

 Yes.  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two

 two controller cards and two disk drives.  Duplexing requires a special

 If you only have one disk, then you can't use Level II SFT.  However, the
 OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different

 that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the

 Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume
 mirrored using SFT II.  Impossible to tell with the network being down.

 Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and
 installing the software as one volume under SFT I.  If the software will
 install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work
 in this configuration.

LPT ports don't recognize baud, parity, etc. settings.  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  Try this: attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC.  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings.  Try

C>MODE COM1,9600,N,8,1

to set the port parameters.  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT1 like this:

C>MODE LPT1=COM1

This should work.  Good luck!

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small ""feature"" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value.
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock.

Most XT IDE controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer.  The controller may
come with software to update its on-board BIOS, or may be designed to work
with a particular drive.  Seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on XT's, and these are tailored to the drive.

Also, you cannot low-level format an IDE drive.  The low-level format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called ""servos"" (not
like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than
the drive's recording heads can generate.  Don't try to low-level format an
IDE drive!

Call Phoenix.  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.

Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!

Just a wild thought here, but how about this: there is a small boot program

this small program that prints the ""Non-System Disk"" error, not DOS.  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is

I don't think that the BIOS is overwritten, there is usually a small routine

Is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a PC.  By this I mean of 
different types.  ie.  RLL and MFM.  If so how do you access the drives
in the CMOS setup.  Do they just show up to be configured or do you 
have to do low level writes to the controller.  

As an example put 1 RLL controller with 2 drives in a machine.  Put
a MFM controller and 2 more drives connected to it.  I now have 4
drives with 2 controllers of different types.  Also can you 
put 2 controllers of the same type into a PC and again how do you access 
them.  

I was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has
done this and can supply me with info I would very pleased

Thanx in advance for any info...

Subject: 66DX2 ISA,VLB xor 50DX EISA ??  Advice wanted...
Organization: University of Western Ontario, London
Nntp-Posting-Host: vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca
Lines: 81


Hi:

I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!
I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  

     -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)

     -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)

     -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under 
	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel

     -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, 
	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of
	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.

I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,
and decided that a ""nice"" system (price/performance) would be:

	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus
	15"" monitor, 1280x1024 NI
	3Com Etherlink III 16bit
	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive

However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise
surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even
have a 50MHz local bus running...

I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus
the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind
that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)



BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following 
configuration:

	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram
	14"" monitor, 1024x768 NI
	SMC Ethercard 8 bit
	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive

We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!
~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or
been uncovered!  

There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish
running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take
a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).

There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive
don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images.

I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This
machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec 
on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases
transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large 
images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it
make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice 
(above), for that reason.

Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

Any information is greatly appreciated.

I know you work at sun, but that's really no reason not to like fast

No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs
the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the
CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive
controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers
tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits,
IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't
an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller
board which handles all of these commands.

The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are
intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the
CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor
to transfer their data.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the 
devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business.
Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the
data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will
also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore
allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept
as dettach/callback.  

Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?

Many (all?) XT drive controllers have their own BIOS on board to handle low-

Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT,
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk
controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format
program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from
debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it ""knows"" about.
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a
third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.

IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug
it in and go to FDISK.

to crash a lot when I use PLAYCD.EXE that came with it a DESQview 2.31 -
Thoughts?  This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and
I load the program up.. If I load the program, it doesn't crash, and I start
the disk, stop the program and start the BBS its OK, but otherwise I have
big problems.. (IE, they can only be solved with a cold boot).

If -anybody- can mail me to help me, I would be eternally grateful 
(unfortunately, my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate
 if you could mail, but by all means, post it too because I'm sure somebody else

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.

Subject: Upgrading the processor on 386/486 machines
Organization: Harvard University Science Center
Lines: 43


In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine
without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with
either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing
power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.
This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz
machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.
note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if
you are running Windows.
Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you
were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed.
There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX
on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX
or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,
then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and
replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for
both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip
costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the
25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the
Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a
20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally
and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.

You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop
around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for
a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.

Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!!


Rationale
---------
The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and
network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,
and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.
 
The reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics,
and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, 
Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. 
Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and
other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in
the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as
index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom
simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging
software, data capture software, data clean up, compression,
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and
video.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.
 
Notes
-----
These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.
Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms
mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.

Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal
width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?
I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I
am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.
Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register
(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)
is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is
there a high bit, and if so, where is it?
Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and
what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very
clear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.
My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I
think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the
non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your

	I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I
can't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is
*extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color
monitors, which is a 19"" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good,
perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across.
	BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well
as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG
can.

Hi,

I recently got a tower-case for my Gateway 486/33 file server, mostly because

Serial cables:

There are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS.
There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.

There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.
The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and
CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and
waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an
error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending
AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very
well have different requirements.

My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but
also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD
and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through
to SG.

I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it
with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.
The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.

The current Adaptec drivers do not support the Toshiba 3401.  you should
get the Corel SCSI drivers, which do support it.

This is the method that I used, and it works well.

Corel's phone number is 1(613) 728-3733

by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA

Subject: *** CONSUMER WARNING ***  MidWest Micro (Ohio)
Organization: Consultant's Connection
Distribution: na
Lines: 54

Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want
to trade elsewhere.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone, ""Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're
having a GREAT Day!"", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.

The details:

I ordered one of their house brand ""Infotel"" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.
In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over
the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not
have ordered it, had I known this in advance.

It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was
preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.

For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the
time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.

Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or
14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested
disabling the COM2 port.

This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long
term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.

I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail 
hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I 
was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they 
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.

I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA
number. She promptly switched me to a ""Tech Support"" rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA
number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I
was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.

Conclusion:

I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more 
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered
a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.

For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know 
will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have
known better...

the Courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price.  I've
never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what
I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably
doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure
if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier
modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.

again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated
the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you
want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find
people who HAVE worked with the Sportster.

personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd
buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this
is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right
now.

and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want
to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to
comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll
get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you
may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts
complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to
avoid spreading faulty info).

>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.

just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in
either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is
currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary
mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.

and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also
supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).

>The difference
>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. 

take a second look at the original question:

>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:
>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST
modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier
V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it
therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.

also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb
version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are
even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.

>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of
>the same type unit to achieve this speed.

HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about
HST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a
proprietary modulation scheme.

>The Sportster will do
>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way
>only.

I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way.....

first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is
part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a
feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the Courier DS manual).

second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed
in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,
and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if
you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of
info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,
a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse
directions.

V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time.

third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.

>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.

again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large
footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which
could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.

later.....

In a 25-pin serial loopback plug, you need to connect the following
pins:

pin 1 to pin 7
pin 2 to pin 3
pins 4, 5 and 8 together
pins 6, 11, 20 and 22 together
pins 15, 17 and 23 together,
pin 18 to pin 25.

That should do it.  Note that *a lot* of these pins are redundant
in many implementations....

Hello,

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version
with the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems:

1 ) I've lost the manual!!!

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when
    the network connection dies.

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)


Shown 54%, press <SPACE> for more, 'q' to quit, or 'h' for help
                                                                                
    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't
know the Bboard number.

    If you can, please help me with as many of the following
as possible:

a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number
b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card
    (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)
c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get
    everything working.

    Any help at all would be much appreciated.

                Thanks in advance,

Subject: Re: Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip?
Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)
Lines: 64

It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible
486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:
And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.

The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX
socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.
the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any
software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the
coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the
actual coprocessor.

The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit
rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance
boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a
386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and
QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,
is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is
around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,
and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2
compatibility, but I didn't test it.

The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains
the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX
PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board
doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when 
access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available
from Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20
only.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.
If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need
to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...

I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K
external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still
significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.

IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or
can't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,
but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure
about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't
beat it in any significant way.

The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,
asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:

Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.
1-800-677-9781
The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00

But....

I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.
If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you
more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,
So I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions
regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.

Date: Wed Apr 21 19:01:49 1993

The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple 
and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an ""idle"" temp - not doing lots of
bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This
is in a Micron computer, without heatsink.

I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.  It
makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc...

Rob,
Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
of use, mine did...
As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink
instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out)
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what
you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes
above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if
you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while!

Boy am I glad that I didn't start out with one of thos PS/2 computers.
I started the upgrade operation out by spending $235 for a AMD386DXL-40
Forex upgradable mother board from Midwest Micro. When it was time to
upgrade I bought a Intel 486DX2-50 cpu for $350 and was finished.

[REMAINDER DELETED]

I don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but I can offer the
following in the interim:

   1)  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 (which are NOT
       configurable).  These addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual.

   2)  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ 2 (for CGA or EGA support??!?).

Lance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)
               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.

I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 4
years now, and have been well taken care of on each purchase.
I have had many friends that have bought that same modem and (THEY)
do have some experience with setting up modems, so there have been
no problems in 6 of them that I know of. The fact that your time
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong.
WHY you say because I must tell you of the 12 yes I say 12 PPI modems
that I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs. They
all were junk and were replace 3 times each, to ther point that
I just said forget it and I wanted my money back. PPI's teck even
said that they didn't even repair them. That they just strip the

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't
know if it was sent or not but. I have never heard of anyone that
had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem
at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.
But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.
When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like
you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.
But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.
I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$
in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award
of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test
bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself.
I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will
not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co.
co from Hayes. I'll just say I hope you like your new modem and
maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine I hope!

All,

During my attempts to find out how the AT harddisk controller
works I stumbled across I/O port 376h. The ""normal"" controller
ports are in the 1F0h-1F7h range, so what does this port do???

The only information I have upto now about this port is that it
is a write only port and the information you have to write in it
is related to the number of heads on the disks.

Could somebody shed some light on this and give me the missing info.

It's the video card.  It's 8514/A compatible, which means it uses the

Subject: Monitors - Nanao?
Article-I.D.: eskimo.C5uw1t.3HI

Lines: 30

Hello, I've been following discussions on 17"" monitors in 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products
as well as some others that may fit the bill.   

I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI.
I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics
board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically
I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large
(=>17"") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been
very happy with a 16"" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty
good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic.

Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are
the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what
scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street
cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them? 
Same info for Sony and Hitatchi.

Thank you very much!!

You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them
*simultaneously*, under Dos at least. Both LPT1: and SB just sit there until
you tell them to do something. You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ7
if you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per 
second.

I totally agree with your friend, since when the CPU is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
(checking for keyboard input for instance).  

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops, where the CPU can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing.  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again.

I dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the
SCSI/IDE cards that is available.  You will have to turn your IDE off.

Instructions for drive type are included with the controller.  With some it may be
a type 1. no matter what the disk is.  With others it may be a type 47.  I had one
controller that I had to tell the BIOS that no hard disk was installed.

Do not low level format a SCSI unless you have the SCSI low level format program. 
First use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.

os, monitor, keyboard, delivery and VAT), but I can't find a single
advert that would give me a system at that price.

Many thanks for your help.

I've got a 386DX-40, 4MB and I'm using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why 
Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch
or something like that). Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and
Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. And so I'm still
wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the
convertional is sufficient? Any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.

I'm using Norton Cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible.
Some games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and Windows
doesn't like it at all. But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only
NCACHE is really fast. You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed. But to
write 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once. Is there any cache program
out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my
applications? Any help is really appreciated.

I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not 
specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he 
has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to 
print the forms properly.

This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported 
dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not 
the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.

Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  
Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
cost?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks

This is normally the case, but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator
as you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board.

IBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola
Corp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong
effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit
processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s
Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50
SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance
for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89
performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down
version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000
workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop
PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,
including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source
noted.

According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to
be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s
486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one
source said.

we are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller.

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section:
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}
 SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these
 modes is mainly in the software drivers.
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. 
 Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for
 a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.
 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using
 SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which
 results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit
 and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software
 drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
 interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term
 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},
 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit}.

8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 
that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software
controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT
NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit
SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1
electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider
16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but
4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1
but is 8-bit SCSI-2.
Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.

8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.

I own a PC FanCard II, which is a slightly different beast.  It's a long card
that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  It requires
no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
longer appears.  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker's (M.S. Tech)
advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running
(w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied
customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order
house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).

Hope this helps,

Half right.
SCSI-1 is SLOWER than IDE {5MB/s vs 8.3MB/s maximum.}
SCSI-2 {8-bit} has a faster BURST rate than IDE {Quarda}
SCSI-2 {16 and 32-BIT} are MUCH faster than IDE {Cyclone in June}

Give the new Viewsonic 17 a good look.  I have seen it side by side with
an old Viewsonic 7, a MAG 17, a Nanao 17"" (not the Trinitron one), and
a Sony OEM 17"" (which does have a Trinitron tube).  The new Viewsonic
beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality, and I think it is

   Even if you are running DOS, if your CPU can't handle the speed of the

an external 9600 bps modem attached and can't drive the serial port any faster

There's also a program called ODYSSEY (MODEM directory on the Simtel

what I was interested in).  I was getting a lot of garbage when I called

Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a
WD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD.
They told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital's BBS
may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.

That's surprising -- I haven't seen any incompatibilities with mine,

Don't even get hyped up.  They are still accepting submissions from the
members for various proposals of how to implement the standard.

You don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable
price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.)
to achieve its performance.

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
after that.

Originator: kruckenb@peruvian.cs.utah.edu

FOR SALE:

AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem

The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer
than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,
v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so
you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone
line.  They will ""fall back"" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with
multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).

I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

Thanks.

OK, here's my results so far....

1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)

2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.
   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)

3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.

OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.

2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA
   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,
   I can get down to 1.

Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...

   I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based e-mail wide area network service
or the necessary network software to establish one myself. While I am aware
there are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve,
Canada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In 
approximate order of importance they are:

1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network
   server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote
   and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)

2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge
   have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is
   essential that the client software is completely pain-free.

3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established
   commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the
   group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be
   something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about
   40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.)

4) The capability for Internet access (for news/mail).

5) Internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)


   If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing, even if it
doesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and I don't care where it is, PLEASE PLEASE
e-mail me and tell me about it. We are not adverse to making alterations to

I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this
as something that was designed-in intentionally.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA)
would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design.

What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT 
along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.
If I were you I would be cautious about this.

You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA
motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are
VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'
32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive
than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.

Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-
board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the
AIR board.

Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.  You can call
Motherboard Warehouse (for example) for a price.  Phone #'s included

I downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be

They're probably for the newer 8900 and 9000 series.

    I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055
seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times, in a
psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01
seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting
ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? I'm trying to do
this in DOS 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work
on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know, I know, I don't like
them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a
possibility. 
    So, basically, any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the
related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on
alternate ways of improving accuracy. Email is preferred, as I'm
planning on posting this to a few boards, and I don't read all of them.
Thanks

Joe

     No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but
there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542):

* You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the
  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.

* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),
  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI
  drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to
  the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

     Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question
gets asked again and again).  At the end of this message, I've included
an edited copy of my reply.  You might find it interesting.

     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers
generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher
throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk
($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a
good SCSI controller.

     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're
used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).
Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking
operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is
mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.
However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.

     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's
cheaper, and you'll have less headaches.

[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what
  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]

     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,
which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the ""better""/""high
performance"" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI
controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased
(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:

* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI
  controllers.

* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).
  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card
  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.

     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape
drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it
works only with Adaptec controllers.

     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a
high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound
right, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,
you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and
Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI
controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape
backups).  If you want a copy of my ""Adaptec 1542 hints and tips"" file,
send email.

     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.

     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC
compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows
3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll
have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than
one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the
possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, ""probably"", because,
while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really
will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know
for sure.  ]

Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified
explanation.

Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer
adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that
""Something's happening here, please take note."" How the CPU is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.
In MS-DOS, the ""interrupt vector"" is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt.

Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready
to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When
DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,
wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to
the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's
free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. 

With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing
approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU
cycles.) Hence, you can't ""share"" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're
running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.

Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is
needed.

You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use
them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came
from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.

Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the
general picture correctly enough.

Cheers,

The U-B PCNIC (also OEMed by IBM for a while) is the only Ethernet card I

But, but, but... How does buying an external modem solve the problem

I had one and on three different motherboards it didn't work with NT and
in some cases DOS. I sent mine back, but it is my understanding that
on some systems such as Micronics motherboards it is necessary to
shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.

I've yet to hear from someone running a 34F on any motherboard with
NT without shutting off the cache.

If you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first.

Do these CPU Fans also have heat sinks?  Do you recommend using both

If we are just talking about a CPU Fan blowing directly on the CPU chip,

I have an Adaptec 1542B and am very happy with it.

Not so! I have both IDE and an Adaptec1542B in the same box and can use both
disks at the same time, eg. IDE to SCSI disk copy.

NO! I'm running both at home. Ok, to the cumpter is turned off right now but I
did boot BSD/386 from an IDE drive, most of the system is on a SCSI drive...

I'm using an Adaptec 1542B and a no-name el-cheapo IDE card.

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice
board.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the
SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was just
buying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanted
a VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast,
will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS
(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight
answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17"" Magnavox,
which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.

But...

That is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh,
and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000,
which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the
>70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base).  So my thoughts go back
to Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the
Graphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since
then.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities
(and price) it has?

Any info would be most appreciated.

There are jumpers on each drive that must be set for both to work.  The C: drivemust be set to be the master drive, and D: must be set to be the slave drive.

Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible)
adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.

I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I haven't had
any problems!

Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
(larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.

That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target
0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen.

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to
select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there.
The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....



ARGH!

Ideas anyone?????

Thanks in advance!

What tube does the Viewsonic 17 use?  Does is support 1600x1280?  I've been
looking a a Philips 1762DT which uses a Sony Trinitron tube, has digital
controls, supports up to 1280x1024NI, and has .25mm dot pitch - It can be
found for under $1000.

I have one of these monitors. It appears to function OK, but is unhookable
to anything standard (CGA,EGA,VGA) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy
diagonal noise. 
I also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board
(double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector
with a picture of monitor). I tried plugging these two into a standard AT
to no avail. How can one connect these to (the monitor seems to
be of relatively high quality, so I'm curious)? Any special drivers and/or
setup needed - I can't locate any jumpers on the card.

Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting
to get a composite sync signal on the ""green""?  There ought to be a
little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert,
and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and
merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all
1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't
think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies
involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.

Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?

With your date/time problems, you MIGHT have a problem with the Dallas

  Hmm your CD-Rom program must be using some oddball VGA modes.

  I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when
it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they
have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out
a bit later).

  Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal
frequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version.  It can
do 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!),
1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and
800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth 
monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,
otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)

  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should
go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the
video sig.  There're several Hercules reps there that are very
helpful.

You don't have to change the bios config.

It's transparent. It works with any drive. If you change the

Yes, no problem.

That depends. You will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. That's
because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower
than access to system RAM. I don't use smartdrive myself,
but I have a few buffers.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now.
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
(ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
to get it to work with odd environments.

For information purposes, I had:

ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE
controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work
in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.

(stuff deleted)

My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so
the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable.
There are other ""board"" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't
know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day
delivery.  The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the
power supply.  PCP&C make the best power supplies available IMHO.

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

Steve's system:

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120

I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3, but

as COM3, with IRQ3 and COM4's address (2E8)!

When I get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows

should be at COM4.

Now, I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested
it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4, 2E8, IRQ3.

To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC, I have to configure the
modem as COM3, 2E8, IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that
allows that, the FAX program that came with the modem does not work.
Anyway, I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set,
as COM4...
I did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all:
a few displayed the modem as COM4, and others displayed it as
being COM3.

I am not using Windows, this is just a DOS problem...Any help
or pointers appreciated....
For various reasons, I must have this modem work at COM4, thus
switching COM ports is not an answer...

X-Posted-From: InterNews 1.0b15@dartmouth.edu
Organization: Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH
Lines: 16

I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5"" drives, in
particular, the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the
Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap,
and have nice 3-5 year warranties. 

My questions are: Is there a catch?
                  Which one is better?
                  What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use?
                  Is the service generally better for one of these     
         
                  manufacturers?
                  Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason?

thanks,

He's right ya know.  I've helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now,
mine included.  On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter,
and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).

In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.
Seems to work for me.

Well, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
worth.

Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,
I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.

Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff.  Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus,
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

Nntp-Posting-Host: mizzou1.missouri.edu

greetings..
I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware.
My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system
when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to
add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to
configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western
Dig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beeped
and gave me an error message about HDD controller.
So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD.
 
any help on this matter would be much appreciated.
(before I trashed my 42MB)
 
Thankx much

Which would YOU choose, and why?

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).
I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according
to NU).

How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for
my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could
hope for)?

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

Thanks for any comments.

Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. Remember
those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5"" floppies? These drives
are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb
disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the
prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently
not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to
develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?

Just a thought.

don't know why it would do this, unless you're out of paper, that is.

when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
light (which, when flashing, doubles as paper out) should light, and a few
seconds later, the green ONLINE light should come on.

hope this helps.....

The Ethernet card doesn't use the IP number (32-bits, usually

cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it.
DECNET requires this feature.

However, that said, there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack.  They have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary

soldering the connections yourself, and usually a bit more reliable.

If you're considering buying a system, with a view to using

Hi peeps,

Here's another of those ""any ideas"" type queries.

I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without
a keyboard.  But no problem so far.

When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard
RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.
The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to
CGA - but useful for my laptop).

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?

I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said
sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?
A UK support dealer said ""Circuit diagrams? Sync?""

So any ideas.

John.

I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem.  We
installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns ""NO DIAL TONE"" on its
line.

When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids' voices
""bleed"" through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem won't dial (even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).

I think it's the phone company's problem, but they say they can't
(won't?) correct the problem...I'm still working on them. ;-}

Seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their

were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the

Since you're using the 5.25 as drive A: it should be at the end after the

Yes

Hope this helps.  I had exactly the same problems.  Unfortunately when
I changed to different machine the problems started again because
of a different FDC.  Seems (don't flame me, this is mainly guess work
from practicle experience) that some FDC's do different things with the

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better
performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.

>Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's?

Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that
are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big
deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to
fight with any low memory problems either.

Doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of WinBench
before blindly running it? The licence agreement very clearly says
that details about hardware configuration, driver, resolution and
other relevant facts *MUST* be included when giving WinMark results.

Ziff-Davis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes

The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation
LX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz.
I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell
you) so you'll have to check.

I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new
motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 MB floppy.

I am interested in using my old power supply (150 W) to power the new
hardware, if possible.  

I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.
(Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the
12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).

My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire
out of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source
to charge the motherboard battery?

I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can 
make use of my existing one with simple hacks.

Thank you for any information.  
An email reply to rarbanas@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine.

set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down.
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting

[discussing the use of IRQ 7]

In  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:

>I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
>(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not

>be dedicated to LPT1.

To put it a little differently:

 - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

 - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer.

 - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it
   in the high-impedence mode.

 - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't
   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper.

   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and
   that certainly isn't a requirement.)

 - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons.  

And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

BusLogic just announced the BT445 FAST SCSI-2 VLB Interface as of
April 20.  This always happens to me!

I have a one week old BT545S which is the ISA version.  I am
enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC2105 560mb 10ms
3.5"" HH 5200 RPM drive.  I'll be changing to the BT445 VERY soon,
though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
the 32bit VESA support.

You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question. I hear that
the support is excellent.   I have not had to call them myself yet.
Regards.

I recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reported
a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 3.0.
This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. Does
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker
and Dblspace?

One of the things going for the DX2-66 (over the 50) is that it's
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec.

Most fellow Diamond video board owners with whom I've corresponded may

all of those with whom I've chatted have NOT been thrilled with the
Window's drivers, either.  Some modes work fine, but others cause
strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc.  Many have also voiced their
strong discontent to Diamond's ambivalent attitude toward OS/2 drivers.

Come to think of it, though, I hear and see a lot of complaints about
the ATI boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
much better.

Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows
(OS/2?) where ALL the modes function properly?  Anyone?  Anyone?

Certainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a
cheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP
200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more
expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.

A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb
flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do
they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy
drive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk
and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.

On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a
PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a
product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format
is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is
identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was
quoted as saying that a 2.5"" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being
productized.

The article said that one of the problems holding back development in
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it
probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it
into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead
to get MDs accepted.

That is, if the special software is free, like Xfree86.  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices.  But
then, they charge $$$$.

I think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  This still
violates the FSF's policy of publically available code.

While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this
will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.

I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software, avoid Diamond.  But if you already
have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just 
typed them in.  Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple
dynamic astigmatism focus'.  Right.  They mean they use two lenses.  Advanced
Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have
been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,
and blue.  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.

But beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  Sharp, clear,
and isn't nearly as bad as the NEC's for reflections.

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This 
will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS 
settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, 
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts 
power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too. 

In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on 
""Setup"" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to ""
Always"" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over 
here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.

Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is?  I would think it would be just as fast, if not 
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future.  I must be missing something, since everyone is 
buying the DX2 66...  Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.

 Thanks a lot,

Subject: ISA GRAPHIC CARD INFO SOURCE
Organization: Universite de Montreal
Lines: 38

HI,
 that might look like a dull request, but I have been following this newgroup
for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind.

  I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!).
The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It
gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only
problem is that it is quite slow.

I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot
of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall
picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.
I would like to get information about :
     - the refresh rates the various cards provide;
     - quality of windows drivers;
     - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).

Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip 
info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied
with it,  let me know.
	If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:
	- Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard)
	- monitor DARIUS 14"" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) 
                               (can reach 70kHz horizontally)  

I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the
graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
enough to record settings.

Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me,

	This is not necessary. All you have to do is modify the config.sys

copy it to c:\ or allow stacker to do it on boot up. 

	Likewise with the autoexec.bat.

The difference is that the 16550 got bugs while the 16550A can be used

This isn't quite true - depending on the number of local bus slots, and
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is
possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz. I've also spoken to a few 
people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble
(and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed).

the ""attached"" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.

I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.

on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00. I
get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.

Yes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've
seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.

My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's
located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the
heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air
flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the 
arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO.

I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it

	To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the 
	Diamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.

	That is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click
	shading and take a look at the patterns.  The 5% pattern
	has been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  The whole list
	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take
	it to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or
	print it and iy shows--badly!  

	Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I can't
	speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.
it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest
but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed. I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.

I have the 1 meg card with the Crystal Scan 15 inch also.  I see very
faint shadows on the left side of the screen only in 1024 x 768 mode,
but not enough to really bother me.  The characters on the screen
are clear until I turn on the Crystal Fonts, then they become blurry.

I have a friend who has 2 meg on the video card who has the same shadows,
but says the Crystal Fonts are, well, crystal clear.

We are both using build 59 of the mach32 drivers. Neither of us has a monitor
extension cable.  I tried the build55 driver and found no difference.

Connecting devices
------------------
 
  Normally, a 7 wire connection is used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
	DTR1    to    DSR2
	DSR1    to    DTR2
	RTS1    to    CTS2
	CTS1    to    RTS2
  If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:
        RI, DCD
  If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.
  BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally
have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2
to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.
 
  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection
can be used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
Additionally, connect (if software needs it):
        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1
	RTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2
	DTR1    to    DSR1
	DTR2    to    DSR2
You won't need long wires for these!
  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission
between two PCs (see software section for details).
  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from
the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals
and DSR & CTS are outputs!

 A suggestion:  Slave (hook in series) a small pilot light off the fan

From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually
""idle"".  They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,
etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter
what it's doing.

I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use
circuitry which has more transistors than other
instructions, but if you consider the additional heat
generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors
and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's
packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate
environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be
negligible.

Has anybody every come across a problem whereby a hard disk locks up (ie. crashes the system) when attempting to load disk caching?

I think the logic board may have been buggered, but the drive works PERFECTLY without a disk cache.

I tried HyperDisk and various versions of SmartDRIVE, all to no avail.

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated .. I need a cached drive, but I need the extra space of my second drive just as much! :-)

Howdy,

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive,
and a high-density 3.5"" floppy.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5"" floppy, which will read, but NOT
WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs.

I have tried everything I can think of.

Any takers?

I have a floppy drive which has developed ""General failure"" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5"" drive).

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.

However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.

Thanks!

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome

Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship

Actually, the iAPX86 family has a HALT instruction that causes the CPU to
cease processing instructions.  The CPU resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt.  This is different
from the power management facilities Victor mentions.  Of course, whether an
operating system's idle loop uses the HALT instruction is another matter
entirely.

I have both!

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box.

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it
has a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape.

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy
does have a 9ms average seek time. I.E it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu
drive for an example!

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!

Which bus???

I think there are several reasons :-

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

What do I have?

A DX50 of course!

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'.

There several reasons for this :-

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted.

When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out.

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!

May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...

Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be
some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use
the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.

Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of ""free interrupts.""  I had a
tape controller (not a ""floppy tape"") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an
*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my
modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt
handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape
controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would
most likely ""hang."")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it
installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for
the serial port.

Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.
That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.
Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)

Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5"" hard drive, model
LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior.

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks.

When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not
the drive.]

My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind
behavior.

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?

I change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again.

No.  The Always IN-2000, among others requires no drivers for up to 7 SCSI

I'm writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports.  This means
virtual mode.  Unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along

I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.

Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using
Hint chipsets.

Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

Using ET4000/W32 drivers
640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.
        32k        7.34

        64k        6.35
1kx786  256        8.17

Using ET4000 drivers.
640x480 16M        1.78
800x600  16colours 4.01     
1kx786   16        4.22

From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.

The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode.

A couple other problems with the 486DX/50:

1.)  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic 
interference problems with 486DX/50 systems.  Getting an FCC-B (home use) 
certification required additional shielding in the system.

2.)  HEAT...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and/or cooling 
fans on their 486DX2/66 chips.  I would guess that the 486DX/50 ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter.  And heat is the enemy of system 
reliability.

Do you mean the ViewSonic 7?  It uses a Matsushita tube.  The Computer

lacking some controls (pincushioning, degaussing, convergence and color).
It was the lowest priced monitor in the test,  and did have good center

The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most
of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are
better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the
DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.

Les,

	I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for
low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)
issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any
difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.
But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim ""low
emissions"" but not specifically ""MPR-II Compliant"" or ""MPR-II Certified""
only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.
	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you
may be more discerning.  Good luck!

Nanao's F-Series (e.g. F550i) and T-Series (e.g. T660i) monitors
are MPR-II compliant.  According to my little pamphlet, the T-Series
monitors are also TCO-compliant, whatever that is.

...

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,
and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM
port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just
searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The
first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by
the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set
of ""standard"" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for
serial ports.

So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were
this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS
to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the
field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that
there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle
program that would actually have a problem with this.)

Anyone have experiences, good or bad, with replacing the MFM controller
and drive with an IDE controller and drive in a Zenith 386/16? I had
heard some rumors about bus mastering problems on some CPU board 
revisions.

Could someone please tell me if the 486SLC and 486SLC2 processors
IBM is putting in their Thinkpad 700's and other PC's is a REAL
486 with a math coprocessor or if it is really some Kludge that
should not be called a 486 at all?

Thanks,
Eric

I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get 
'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem is
also steadily getting worse.

I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the
drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly 
flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).

Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these
sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.
I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers
would be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!

I am running MS-DOS 5 on an AT clone.

I have a PC Power and cooling fan and it is a heat sink with a built in fan 
that glues on top of the CPU.  Even if the fan quits you still have the heat 
sink fins to aid cooling.  The glue, of course, is the type that has high 
thermal conductivity.

I know this is the wrong newsgroup, but I was wondering if anyone

Or has it passed already?? E-mail if possible. Thanks.

I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several 
useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by 
removing the fan altogether!

Two variables: 
1) I always run my PC without the cover, and 
2) I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference.

Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so 
I'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? You're answer 
may save my PC... Thanks.

Subject: STRANGE DISK BEHAVIOUR

I have a 286 with a Western Digital WD-93044A hard drive. This drive is 
782 cylinders with 4 read write heads PHYSICALLY, but LOGICALLY it is
977 cylinders with 5 read write heads (??!!).  In the CMOS setting
I am instructed to set it to type 17 (IBM 977 cyl. 5 read/write heads),

THE PROBLEM:  I was sent Western Digitals ISPFMT low level program from
the manufacturer, and was instructed to run it on the hard drive with
the CMOS setting set to type 17.  This worked ""o.k."" and I verified the
disk using the same program.  I then reloaded DOS which did a high
level format, again no errors, no bad sectors, etc.

BUT.... when I run Norton Speedisk 6.01 (or any other disk optimizer)
with the verify option set ON, I get ERROR verifying sector NNNN,
where NNNN can be any number (not the same all the time).

ANY IDEAS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WOULD BE APPRECIATED!

Thank you!

I have a 486 DX 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. 
I'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know
if i can use a DX/2 66Mhz cpu. The BIOS is late model AMI, circa 1991,
and the system crystal is approx 66.3Mhz. 

My question is, can i just replace the original 33MHz cpu with the new
DX/2 cpu? If its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling
devices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans??

Mike
