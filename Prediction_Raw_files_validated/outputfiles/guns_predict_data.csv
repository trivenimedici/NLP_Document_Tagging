So far, there is NO credible evidence that the BD's set the fires
themselves. We only have the ATF/FBI's sayso. Law enforcements type

Well, it seems we don't learn the lessons of history do we?

First the FBI said they saw two members of the cult start the fire-and the 
FBI never lies.  Second, the first started in opposite ends of the compound 
at the same time and thirdly, the fire spread too quickly for it not to be 
help without an accelerate.

A great deal of documentation exists on exactly that phenomenon. Especially
regarding Vietnam and the Mai Lai (sp?) massacre

Not that I'm suggesting that they started it on purpose but even if they
now know that they accidentally started (or contributed to it) you can
be sure the initial reaction is to lie. Remember the Iranian airliner
which the US navy mistook for a fighter and shot down?

Organization: CSLI, Stanford University

CNN just reported the ATF and the FBI have begun killing everyone in the
United States. A press release stated this action was required because
bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their
homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday
do something illegal. An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated
that ""this would clean up things once and for all"".

If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has
indicated they will ""burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco"". 
It hasn't been decided how the new proposed ""energy tax"" will enter into
this, an IRS representative stated ""We're looking at the tax code to determine
if taxes really end at death. With this many dead Americans, we don't want
to overlook anything"". An ATF agent ran into the room, and shot her.

Stay tuned....rich

Here are a few ideas:

1) a free library card so they can look up the FBI
   Uniform Crime Report which shows how good HCI is
   at lying through their teeth,

2) a free RTD Transit Pass which will allow anti-gunners
   to tour South Central Los Angeles and convince
   people living there that they don't need guns to protect
   themselves because the police will do it for them 
   (don't lose the pass, you'll need it to get out),

3) a free bus ride to Vermont, which has almost no gun
   control and, curiously enough, almost no crime either,

4) a free calculator, since anti-gunners have heretofore
   been unable to figure out what a small percentage of
   the guns owned in America are used to commit violent crime.

I don't know this specific ratio, but I do have an earlier post that says
a gun is 33 times more likely to defend someone (including the times where
the gun isn't fired, just scares the perpetrator away) than it is to kill
someone. (including self defense)  The post is kind of long, but I'll be
glad to dig it up and email it to anyone who asks.

	And they killed a few people of their own, including one child
at last report.  So what?  Being a federal agent is not license to kill.
Then there's CNN indicating that the ATF/FBI actually *DID* start the
fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people.  If you're

Note that this doesn't affect all concealed carry.  (Look after the
word ""except"".)  It always helps to read the law before commenting on
it.

Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  How about someone at
home?  Note that both are legal, and a lot of ""common"" people qualify
for one or the other.

And you'd be wrong about that too.

Note that Texas isn't unique in this ""more with-gun deaths than
with-car deaths"", but some of the other states where it happens have
extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the ""meaning"".

It isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car

Give it up for what?  Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so
it fails by this standard.

That's half the question - the rest is ""and what do you get for your
sacrifice"".  If the answer to the second question is ""nothing"", as it
is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question
because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.

I leave the anti-semitism to anti-gun types like Holly Silva.  I have in

It is an outlaw agency run by incompetants who only have contempt for

I attribute the acts of the FBI to stupidity.  I attribute the acts of

It was merely to call attention to the hazard of having Specter involved.

To Rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.
   The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the 
building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed
with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit 
for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims 
that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped
into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either
bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.
I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS
gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY 
uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in 
the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less 
eat.  So my question now is ""why were they cooking food?""
   I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.
But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more
crazy than the ATF/FBI claim).

Well, I only saw it start in one place.  A tank punched a hole in a wall,
and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that
a 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and
fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent
accident.

Maybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive
in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time.
What if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know
about the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in
sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds?

Cripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?  Maybe you ought to stop

Wellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened

and hardware.  And as far as ""evidence"", what are you talking about?  
Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get
questioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage

killed 'em all 51 days ago"" don't feel that way, but then you're probably

Not in such a great degree.  Bush broke one promise, maybe two (taxes/guns)
and we held him accountable for it.  Of course, it took him the better part of
4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots
of them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that.

Hmmm.... Apparently you just got here.  Nobody's claiming that it was anything
but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally
don't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked
the Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such
a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie.
Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs
during their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the
timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW
that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are
trying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing
on the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for
approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is
the case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did,
and this time, people are just paying more attention to it.

*sigh*

It is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign
them to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation
into possible misconduct is going on. The Administration has given no
indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that
the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the
decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all
activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates
to an enforced vacation.

Perhaps you've been under a rock since, say, the turn of the century. How
in the #$^& is one man supposed to review every single freaking
governmental action, every day? That's why we have an executive branch. HE
reviewed the plan and said ""go,"" but he wasn't the architect and he wasn't
there, bullhorn in hand, implementing it. Yes, he was responsible in the
sense that he was briefed. So what! Shit happens. That sounds like a
callous way to dismiss the deaths of 90+ people, but I can't understand why
people get so bent about the accidental death/suicide (which is it? could
take months...) of some total fucking sociopath/child molester and his
crazed followers while opposing U.S. intervention in Bosnia. Just like
Billy boy said. I think some of you people have too much time on your
hands, and screwed up priorities.

Here goes:

More than a few years back (if you were born that year, you can legally drink),
we tried it out.  We found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft.
2X6s.  We put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans)
stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom.  After lighting the
fire, we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can.  We heard pops, one solid
bang and several ""fizzzz shussss"".  After we thought the excitment was over, we
boldly climbed down to find that NONE of the bullets had left the can, several
of the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all
died of smoke inhalation.  And 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers!

  I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were
talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

  A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not
that wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con-
ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person
home.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have
my own shotgun in my apartment.

  Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no,
I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying
that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence
that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.

  It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.  
Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this)
to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.

  I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever 
bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons,
and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't
got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. 
If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that
is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per-
verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something
in their state.

You don't have to pay attention to any one source, neither do you
have to abandon your critical thinking, but to disregard all sources
of information as 'lies' and 'distortions' and substitute your own
pet theories is more likely to get you wild untruths than by basing
your theories on the 'facts' as they are reported by the media and
the government.

> There has beed NO evidence of

Actually there was evidence of the fire being set deliberately -
both testamony by the survivors and IR tape showing the fire
being set in 3 places AND the petrochemical soot that the fire 
was giving off (indications of kerosine or gasoline feeding the
fire).  

You might not believe 1 or 2 if you are totally paranoid or very
skeptical, but my 3rd point is visible to anyone who watches the
tapes of the fire and has started a BBQ grill.

The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins
of the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was 
crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, 
would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV 
news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.
Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent 
with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...

Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.
Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being
worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those
on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they
thought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to
put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and 
concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable
of moving.

: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.

Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the 
things that the FBI said (""The BD's started the fire.""  ""The BD's bodies
were found with gunshot wounds."") that are now being refuted by the 
evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making
statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make
them sound like fact.

Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop
string of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations
on numerous occasions.

And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until
they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If
the BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be
dead today?

Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now
if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of
apologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected
accountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would
happen as often as they do.

Acutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of
this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  
Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after
the initial raid on the BD's.  ""Coincidence?  I think not!""

And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over
walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince
the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by
the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to 
a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the
building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to 
cover its ass.

This is, apparently, what passes for intelligent discourse at Trinity.
Joe ""FBI cultist"" Kusmierczak gets angry when its pointed out that
the FBI has told him is a LIE, the mounting evidence is that 
they've lied about almost every detail of 4/19 except that they
were there. What can you expect of cultists like him, somebody
oughtta burn him out, and if he's trapped, well, good riddance!

Some of the survivors have been ""interviewed"" on TV as they were going

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth,
you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with
the newsreporting if you care.

Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he
is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also
lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their
stories to match the Feds.  

Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested,
but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves
to the ratings and deliberately distort.  

For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds
did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real
unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so
I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus 
being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto,
so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they
were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  Thsi conclusion, I came
to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio
shows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some
innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise).

Yes.  Given the history of the BD's and the fact that they were just 
peacefully minding their own business, I think this would have been
the correct course of action in the very beginning.  Everything that
followed was a direct result of the major media fuck-up that the BATF
perpetrated just over 51 days ago.

Yep, no doubt about it.  They should have just bombed those kooks
right from the git-go.  Yeah, sure!  So much for any resemblence
to an America that abides by the Constitution.  So much for feeling
safe in your home.  So much for any of the rights enumerated in the
Bill of Rights being upheld.  Why bother?  They just get in the way
of an effective government.  That is, a government of the elite, by
the elite, for the elite.  

Joe, attitudes like yours frighten me.  You have very few facts about
what actually happened, and what information you do have came from a 
single source, the FBI/BATF.  Yet you are more than happy to pronounce
the BD's guilty-as-charged based on this one-sided testimony.  Scary!

Two notes of interest from Texas:

The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering
judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few
years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had
his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black.

The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for
the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"".  The DPS
was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as
""traffic cops"".  ATF now has two strikes against them.

Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF
agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the
flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you
wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF.

In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians
would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the
fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and
therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining
Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this
theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there,
and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She
actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).

While I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway), 
it is incidental to their reaction.

Yeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me.
Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs,
is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to
disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups
who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that
this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never
know...

Or, did anyone notice that when Clinton referred to the Davidians as
'religious fanatics' that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from
the reporters ? 

To me this was not only in poor taste, but it showed the media's bias and
hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe.  No wonder they
have been cheerleading for the kgBATF and the FBI during this whole affair.

pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization

about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the

Then you didn't understand my grumble...  Again, I said to get a
CORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that
something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern
capitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then
I've even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but
don't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the
text, right?... ;-)  [p.s.  I have found about 10 *different* versions
of the Constitution on the network; And accuracy DOES matter...]

In Massachusetts, you will likely be arrested for murder, but
if you convince the cops/DA that you used lethal force because
of threat of death or serious bodily harm, then the charges
would probably be dropped.  If you run away and are later caught,
then you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury
of your innocence.  Going ""on the lam"" is seen as an indication
of guilt by a lot of people.

This whole thread is rediculous.  Who cares if they had a stove going
or not.  Does it matter if they had a stove burning, or lanterns
burning, or candles burning, or someone smoking, etc, etc, etc.  The
premise is that the FBI was filling the house with napalm so that it
would catch fire.  This is crazy.  FBI was NOT PUMPING NAPALM into the
Davidians home.  You will have to have pretty damn strong evidence to
convince me of that.

I can believe mass suicide/murder by Koresh.  I can believe an
accident by the Davidians.  I can believe an accident by the FBI.  I
can easily believe mass stupidity on all sides but I can not believe
that the FBI lit this fire intentionally.  No way.

The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start
violence.
 
When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.
But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for
their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It
is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical
attention that the BD were not looking for trouble.
 
If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as
hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they
had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening
chips for medical attention etc.
 
A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one
has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent
that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they
could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their
fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It
appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking
ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but
they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.
 
All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the
BD.

Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will
start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches
fire at once.
 
This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed
by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and
broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but
was really one big fire.
 
Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.
When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them
to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room.
 
I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final
assault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show
their agents of the the FBI overcoming the ""forces of evil"", aka
the Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove
that they were not using excessive force.

Just from experience, seeing a couple of houses burn down, one doesn't
need any accelerant to get a lot of black soot.  There's plenty of
stuff in a house that will burn 'dirty'.  Even the asphalt shingles
would make a really sooty smoke.

The President is not competent to plan or judge the planning of such a
raid, nor does he need to be.  His job is to set basic policies and
manage the people under him.  If Clinton instructed Reno to preserve
lives, and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as
could be, then he did his job.  The President should not involve
himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations.  This sort
of micromanagement only leads to disaster, as was demonstrated so well
in Vietnam.

But the raid went bad:  Over 80 civilians have been killed in a
controntation with U.S. authorities.

NOW Clinton enters the picture in a big way.  Will Clinton start an
investigation?  Or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate?
Is he a responsible leader?  Or is he only interested in protecting
the image of his administration?

We'll all find out as this unfolds.

Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.

I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't
make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the
opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose ""the authorities""
might have been a better term than ""society"".  Carry and use a firearm
in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect,
at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do.
And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that
actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.

   In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or
   so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-
   abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny, 
   though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a 
   lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.  
   IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or 
   a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-
   grabbers' logic.  

Agreed.

   You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as 
   important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious 
   good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities 
   about something as big and diverse as US society.

My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable
weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload
of trouble should you be forced to use them.

   Or by the
   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause 
   to someone who would be a criminal anyway.

I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.  
   
   Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself
   if others' thoughts are not that kindly,

That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to 
have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.

I *think* we agree on this issue.  I guess my position didn't
survive the transition from cognition to ASCII.

What is ""doing it right the first time""?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks? 
Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented
to date, I haven't seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD's bought
components to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that
they had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may
have been legal (given recent court rulings).

What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and
lwaful thing.  Or did you just want the BD's dead?

So far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE
of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  If this continues to be
the case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story,
wouldn't it?  And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch
a bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  The bullet hardly moves,
it is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal
force.  It will hurt, yes, but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate
a coat, for example.

How about an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full subpoena powers, and
powers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible
illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?  I
cannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use
so often, ""if they have nothing to hide..."" they should welcome it,
and vigorously support it.  Note that an internal investigation by the
Dept of Justice is NOT an independent investigation...

Obviously you missed my earlier posting about the physica of woodstoves.
In brief, you can't turn your woodstove on and off like your gas range.
It stays on all the time.  It even stays ""on"" for over 24 hours AFTER you
shut it off (which is why most working woodstoves aren't ever ""shut off""
until spring).

Saying ""hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y"" is *much* different
from saying ""hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y.""
Here you've made both statements.
If the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X, then
perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement
is not something to base policy decisions on!

> Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
>ages 14 and under.

According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly
the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you
think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the ""leading causes of
unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other
means as causes of unintentional death.  Can't you see past the bullshit?

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the
anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by
firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use
these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm
sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning
accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,
but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun
control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.
The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may
be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.

Sorry if it wasn't clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view
of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully
preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on
all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who
aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to
commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a
positive way for police to respond to ""interpersonal violence.""

What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit

everyone up to age 24 ""children"" when they're screaming about the ""carnage

Ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be
such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People
2000 document is to ""enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of
handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the
likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?""  The
agency that funded the ""study"" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban
had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of
a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?
It wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their ""post law""

What's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary
school I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a
problem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also
been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the
car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns,
it's the parents!!!

I don't think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that
if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he
believed the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn't say
he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what
he thought was going on.  He thought he had them in the one place where
harm *wouldn't* come to them.

You're sitting in your home reading a good book.  Your neighbors think
you're a quiet, upstanding citizen.  A random person anonymously calls

Ah, I see.  They're supposed to send 100 men in horse trailers with
automatic weapons, storm onto your roof, and throw grenades at your 
house with no warning.  Then, after subjecting you to noise torture
and telling the national news media for a month what a filthy son of 
a bitch you are, they're supposed to gas you and knock your house 
around a bit until they manage to collapse it, cause a fire, or 
something equally conclusive.

Hope your neighbors don't tumble to this -- at least none of them that
might have a craving for a ringside seat at some cheap but dramatic 
local entertainment at someone else's expense.  Or maybe even
PARTICULARLY at your expense.

At least they won't have to read you your rights, Joe -- obviously you

  There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I
saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with
air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more
likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to
the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing
the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane
typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell
leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere,
and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially
semi-rural areas.

  I think it would have disarmed many people if the FBI followed this same
policy.  They have not.  They are making claims without evidence, and what
evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.

From what I saw of the videotape, there was an explosion which looked

ammunition.

I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not
ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise.

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally,
in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded ""national exposure,""
but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.

The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.
We'll never know if he would have kept that one.

Quite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing 
line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and 
negligent manslaughter.

It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to ""go state's
evidence,"" parrot the FBI story, hang the whole ""suicide"" on Koresh, 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this
in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them
do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is
dead wrong.

The suggestion that they Davidians committed suicide is
completely without evidence.  Except for the editorials...

Please re-word.  ""propensity for allegedly dousing themselves"".

Oh, and the survivors claim the the FBI started the burning
by accidentally igniting kerosene lanterns (remember that they'd
already cut the power), and the propane tanks.  This sounds
a lot more likely than committing suicide by setting the place
afire.

I take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if
a bunch of people say it is?  For instance, if some people go on a
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
does this mean that what these people have done isn't bad?  This is an
example of mob rule not a democracy---a democracy in which people's
rights are protected.  I hope that I've made myself clear on this.

Hmm... all reports from Texas authorities indicate that none of the children
which the group released showed any signs of child abuse.. given that the same
results were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations,
I can pretty much state that I strongly suspect the government of disinformation
/deception on this issue.  And about stockpiling weapons/food, many recognized
religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food, and some even
maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition, why are those two facts grounds 
for an armed assault?  And from the dollar value of the weapons purchased, 
if they bought decent firearms it comes out to about one handgun, rifle, and
shotgun for each adult, with a few extras...  Going by that rule, the BATF
best get ready for the fight of their life when they assault Alabama...

I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go
jogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being
watched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned
according to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting
them, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted
to have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...

He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered
peacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).
He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.

The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased
$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).
Last I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an
INDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door
shoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I
know of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?
I sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated
like the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it
is a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the
BATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt
people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved
religeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these
days?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT...

MY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation,
and NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence.

>2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

They had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further wait
would have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency
gear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water
when a fire was observed, instead of saying ""aw, gee, there is no water"".

Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building
had pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision
the firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't
the Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough...

One does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'...

What does 'taking responsibility' mean?  You think she is going to be
facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think
she is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to
have acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though.

I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation
for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.
I expect to hear ""they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't do
anything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue"".

I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting and
subpoena powers.  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found.
Fat chance, I bet.  I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal
investigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'.

I hope I am wrong, that this is gone over with a fine tooth comb.

Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about
by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)
perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the
fire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and
rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them?

In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?

Does that sound plausable?  Not as dramatic as Korash forcing them to
stay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...

Some chiefs will grant you a ""personal protection"" permit if you have been

It's a crap shoot, and your rights are the stakes.

They threatened no one.  Their neighbours thought they were a little
strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live
next door to.

One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out
of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If
this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know
that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof
that these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend
themselves.

: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me
: they *realy* belong in society ...

If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it
is not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The
people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by
the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is
claiming that the 'cult' started the fire.

'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but
I'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say
about it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.

Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident:

1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing
    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least
    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify
    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as
    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to
    be police.
    
2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:
    + ""We only had handguns"" - the original footage showed 4 BATF
      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5
      assault sub-machine gun.
    + ""We were out gunned"" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the
      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you
      have the best guns available for the job.
    + ""We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!"" -
      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot
      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that
      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly
      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are
      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter
      plywood.
    + ""We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.
       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.
       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.
       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.""
      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily
      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.
      
3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one
    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would
    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did
    AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh?

All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be
taken with a grain or two of salt.

This is really uncalled for.

You cannot expect a European, growing up in a culture of ""rulers"" and 
""subjects,"" to immediately grasp the concepts of individual independence
and citizen sovereignity in the US.

He's less at fault than the countrymen we have here who also can't grasp it.

Isn't it ironic.  I'm of that generation, and I remember the lesson.  I
cry to see all the postings from domestic .edu sites that have naively
swallowed everything the government has seen fit to feed to them.
Especially contrasted to such a post from the .uk yet.

I suspect we saw the latter.  However, the injustice implied in letting
those involved escape without investigation and/or prosecution is also
horrible to contemplate.

One might well ask if CA gun owners have given up on the NRA/CRPA.

			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT

			      by J. Neil Schulman

If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,
right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call
would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call
if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning
of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?

That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los
Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton
Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.
Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor
journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of
""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""

A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's
expertise.

Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at
USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field.

He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam
Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's
fifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been in
continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner
of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.

That sounds like an expert to me.

After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent
the following letter:

""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.

""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being
necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under
oath to support, if necessary.""

My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,
then concluded:

""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.
While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""

After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political
subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):

[Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the
security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a
clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb
'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia.

""In reply to your numbered questions:

[Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""

[Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people.""

[Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed'?""

[Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence
is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""

[Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact
necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not
existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
shall not be infringed' null and void?""

[Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""

[Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""

[Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as
previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia.""

[Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated
militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'
'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""

[Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military.""

[Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200
years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""

[Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since a
well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'

[Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second
Amendment to the following sentence,

""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be
infringed.'

""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,

""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;
and

""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for
example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""

[Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure.

""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation.""

Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his
cover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach
any conclusion.""

So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what
many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally
protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all
governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.

As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.

And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States
ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.
American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning
arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,
guaranteed by the Constitution.

And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the
rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but
means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?

Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution
of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789.
Moreover, ""controlled"" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling.

Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a ""well-regulated
militia"", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT
under the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the
constituion used it in that way.

Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than
""individual right, not to be interfered with by govt"".

Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on
govt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review
article for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated
militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.

I see that I misphrased my question.  I should have asked WHICH
full-autos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semi-auto
look-alikes.  I should have also included some semi-auto only guns in
my list to see if he'd ask how to distinguish them from their
non-existent full-auto ""relatives"".

Let's do the former now.  Kratz has claimed that he can visually
distinguish full-autos from semi-autos.  For which full-autos is he
making that claim?  How does he do it?  Let's get specific, and as
exhaustive as possible.

Maybe?  Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows?

Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from
a two position switch via TV inspection?  (Does he even get to see the
switch in the typical police display of guns?)  Note that one might
well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection
even though it won't be seen on TV.  And to think that Kratz was
telling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being
there....

>How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
>semi-auto and fully-auto fire?

Why all the questions?  Kratz assured us that he could make this distinction
and now he's asking us how he did it....

>Well, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be

What about it?  It only demonstrates that, as I predicted, Kratz

   Did I say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent?
 NO.  I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting
in any way to justify gun control.  You're right, any death is serious.
THAT was my point to Joe who said that ""anti-gunners"" try to convinve
the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious
problem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem.
No, I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches
to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.  And please don't
say that tired old NRA line ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"".
Sure, people can kill people without guns.  But easy access to guns makes it
a lot more convenient.  ""Guns don't kill people, People with easy access to
guns kill people"".

    Jim, I'm just saying how it is.  I'm not saying if that is a good thing
or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun
buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are
having an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory
component to the program, they say ""well no...""  So, in answer to your
question, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to
show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal
gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure
the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test
evaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are
essentially saying ""look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't
want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community"".
If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.

  Religion has nothing to do with this.  I could care less what religion

simple.  Difference is good Jim, I am the most progressive and diverse
person in the world.  But, if different is allowing kids to be exposed
to tanks and tear-gas, then yes Jim, DIFFERENT IS WRONG.

Folks,

It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our
federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our
local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be
asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation
at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake
up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth
from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging 
at my gut.  The list will probably grow. 

1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that
     the BATF obtained?

2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition
     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a ""no-knock""
     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the 
     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without 
     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock 
     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant 
     in a manner prescribed by law?

3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents
     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.
     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building
     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.
     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an
     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to
     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening
     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 

4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that
     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over
     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the
     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms
     License, were they actively participating in the legal business
     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the
     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence
     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally
     dispossessed weapons.

5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,
     a BATF spokeswoman stated ""We were outgunned!"".  Yet, TV newscasts
     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents
     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the
     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's
     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)
     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the 
     scene of the original assault on the complex?

6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the
     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a ""hostage""
     situation? 

7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use ""psychological warfare""
     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and
     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any 
     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the 
     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?

8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex
     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable
     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away
     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers
     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?

9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch
     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members
     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an 
     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a 
     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident 
     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the 
     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  
     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle 
     penetrated?

10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and
     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,
     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas
     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any
     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI
     have that a mass suicide pact existed?

11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on
     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition
     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be
     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas
     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence 
     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition 
     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,
     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were 
     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the
     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect
     for someone engaged in such a legal business?

12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical
     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to
     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is 
     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will 
     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?

13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the
     complex, ""over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.""  On the video
     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles
     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one
     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no 
     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,
     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be 
     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  
     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, 
     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be 
     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do 
     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas 
     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by 
     shots from high-power rifles?

14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United
     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use
     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use
     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally
     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?

15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered
     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had
     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county
     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet
     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within
     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?

According to an AP report (from Texas, written by Jaime Aron) this morning,
in addtion to the gas pumped in by hoses from CS generators, canisters of
tear gas were thrown into the building from armored vehicles, one of the
canisters hitting a man inside in the face.

This was in the part of the article *before* going into differences in

Tear gas canisters *used* to be able to start fires...

hello,

I just want to make 2 points:

1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence,
education, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive
training. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any
conspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't
believe it.

2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the
latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of
Koresh saying, ""light the fire"", and you can have one. Need a thermal
imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of
computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these
pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we
get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any
FBI video is because it is:
	1) classified
	2) too gruesome for our eyes
	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it

Dwayne Jacques Fontenot

BTW, I get my information from live video feeds. I read the papers too,
but almost everything in them contradicts what I have seen with my own eyes.

This is the AP story from Fri morning.

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader
David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began
looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and 
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    
compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.
   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the 
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    
since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's 
phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the
cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.
    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel
compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the
women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all
under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    
was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building
it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.
Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling
the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than
the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks
made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to
gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle
headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to 
find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.
  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The
FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult
members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions
at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of 
propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,
it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and
other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked 
together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others
died groping in the blackness.

Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it's worse.

The problem is, the devil is in the details.  You know, the Brady Bill
sounds like a ""good idea"" too, until you discover that there is NO check,
and that the police DON'T have to allow your purchase even if you check
out, and that you have NO recourse if they don't.

Are there any loopholes here?  I'm no lawyer, I can't be sure.  I
would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady
Bill, for example.

The more words involved, the more details.  What was that saying about
Abraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern
Congress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?

That only works with bad laws.  Good laws are like good computer programs.  
Quality has to be written in from the start, not added on later.

People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's
no longer necessary to be an ""independent thinker"" to depart from the
government's party line.  It looks like our ""independent press"" may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is
a good sign.  I hope it continues.

Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented, ""coming to a conclusion"" is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
to challenge those ""facts"" critically.  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.

Hey, joe -- assuming you're old enough to remember it -- how did you feel
about presidential responsibility every time Reagan said ""I don't recall"" 
about his arms-for-hostages meetings with the Ollie North gang?

How did you feel about it when Bush said he ""was out of the loop on that
decision"" when he was right there in the thick of it?

Oh, right.  ""He was responsible in the sense that he was briefed, but so
what -- shit happens!""  Is that what you said?

Hear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
that multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions
inconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions
either way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government

No, Frank Crary's arguments are based on the assumption that most people
are sane, normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. USEnet as a whole
disproves it of humanity as a whole.

We now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer. Buy a lot of
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the FBI to burn
down your house. See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
to support gun control.

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and
the type of gun being studied.

Some cites:

---------------------------------------

A recent BATF study (titled ""Protecting America, Yes"") surveyed 471 career 
criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were
purchased from retail dealers.

                              by James D. Wright

(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct
    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.

Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most
recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a
licensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --
obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving
friends and associates, family members, and various black market
outlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources
included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and
often theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated
by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.

              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY
                             By David B. Kopel

     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.
The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous
criminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable
impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns
are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.

51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal
Enforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of
20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;
of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who
committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)
(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony
convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to
Director, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony
records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or
non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).

                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel

     Testimony before Congress revealed that most ""assault weapons"" in the
hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony
is consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings
based on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by
sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent
of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The
figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the
criminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents
of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and
probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of
guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime
directly target the black market in criminal guns, and
leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright
believes that the consequences of current ""assault weapon"" legislation on
street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun
controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of
criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new
business.{100}

Look, folks, I don't know what happened in Waco.  I do not claim the BDs are  
angels, I never did.  Koresh may very well be the devil incarnate.  I just  
don't know.  But I do know that I must question any single source of  
information, such as we have here.  And I must question even harder given that  
it is single source at the insistance of that very government.  What ever else  
happened at WACO, that is perhaps the biggest evil done.  And even more so in  
light of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the  
state officials.

But what I really don't understand is the hoards of devoted government  
worshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong.  They  
are fanatic to the point of making things up, such as Brent's microwave oven  
disclaim of the BD's using fire for food heating.  

I am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power Koresh  
held over the BDs, and the demonstrated power the government holds over those  
rapid apologists.

NNTP-Posting-Host: kazak.nmsu.edu
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]


The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article
on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal
tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.
type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,
and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.
The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student
(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...

(The title was the only thing they changed/added)

""Gun Stats""

The Daily recently reprinted an article from the
Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton
Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,
in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The
article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This
is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-
eral reasons, outlined below:

The study gives the impression that, if you own a 
gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to 
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you.  The study, however, fails to take into
account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun 
to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-
trator.

The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every
month, the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a
friend.

The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample 
size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-
stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.

Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-
erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be 
used, successfully, by a private citizen against an 
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a 
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.
Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies 
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can 
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-
rate conclusion from them.

Good irony.  The Waco finale was on April 19, Patriot's Day.
On that day 218 years earlier, the militias of Concord, Mass.,

I tend to agree, but I would like a better explanation of why the FBI stopped  
the firetrucks at the gate.  I saw this in realtime.  It concerns me that the  
FBI ""appeared"" to not be too interested in stopping the fire after it started,  
and actually started flying hueys around the compound, which had to add in some  
small part to the winds driving the fire.

This claim hasn't been retracted or contradicted yet, as many earlier
government claims have?  At least one clip showed a fire erupting
after a tank busted in a wall.  We have unsubstantiated claims by
the government about the FLIRs spotting ""simultaneous"" fires.

That's easy.  Six hours of CS gas, heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading
fire, confusion, panic.  Only 10% got out.  The building was collapsing
all around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck.

>And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.

The Davidians may have committed suicide, or some few zealots among
them might have started the fires -- that is possible.  But, given
the government's earlier inability to tell a straight story, I find
my above scenario equally possible.  I wait for some independent
investigation to look into the whole thing.

It would be one thing if the government spokespeople had been
consistent and forthright throughout.  Keeping the press far away
and ghettoized in ""pools"" was not conducive to building up trust.
Sealing the warrants was non-optimal, as well.  This operation
was out of control from the git-go.

Speaking only for myself, I think Bush and Reagan should have been
impeached over Iran-Contra.

In 1979, I would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to
the government.  No more.  Like I said, I'll wait to see the
results of an independent investigation -- if there is one --
before I choose whom to believe.

Funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no
evidence ONE WAY or ANOTHER that there were bullet wounds --
not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are
deemed speculative.  INCLUDING reports that there were NO
bullet wounds.

Summary: FBI did call for firetrucks immediately; experts say 3 fire sources
Organization: Chinet - Public Access UNIX
Distribution: na
Lines: 38


Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the 
compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes 
from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. 
Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits 
required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally 
out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local 
community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By 
the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame 
and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers 
and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, 
but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not 
have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the 
line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient 
equipment and water to make a difference.

They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia 
asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably 
irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local 
calls could get through.

ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who 
viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the 
standard ""pool shot""), and agreed that the fire a) must have been 
started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant 
to spread so fast.

Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed 
themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot 
stronger proof than some of the ""theories"" floating around the net.

Score 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians. Or is that -89 Branch Davidians?

Once again, Koresh closed the door on an agent with a search warrant,
and the door was then perforated by a rain of bullets from the
inside.

They shot first.

Indeed.  Larry King had the two attorneys (whose clients are now
dead) of Koresh and another Davidian on his show last night.  Their
discussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account.  The
attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns
in the compound which started the fires.

Government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other 
throughout this whole affair.  I'll wait for some better evidence before
I form an opinion.

It's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a 
""fiery apocalypse""...just a thought.

Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the
timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of
wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything ""new""
that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going
to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't
it be more ""reasonable"" to believe the BD's would set the fire early
after the assault began?  

The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting
of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I
was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter
(watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least
one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.
Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of
the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been 
penetrating a few feet.

Attention please!

According to the rules of usenet flame wars, once a discussion degenerates
to the point where Hitler is mentioned, that flame war may be declared
ended.  I would like to take this opportunity to do that now.  Clearly
further discussion is not useful with the current set of facts, and the

Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  If they needed
to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the
federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type
assaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the
tactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would
not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I
believe) was so bogus.  

Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls
service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby
large city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own
guys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun
control.   

	I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. 
Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their
""assault weapon"" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget
was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got
confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);
right around the presidents 100th day in office.   As a wise man once
said: once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy
action.    I don't believe that these four things are conincidental.  Do
you?

It was filmed the day of the first assault.  The BDs clearly allowed the
BATF agents who were shot and wounded to leave the compound.  The

are dead and then get the fuck outa dodge. Never give a pig an even

In the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start
that, I know) the medical examiner has *not* contradicted
the FBI.

The FBI said they found some folks who had been shot in
the head, and the medical examiner said ""we have not seen
evidence of this"".

At the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing
with charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like
typical medical examiner not releasing details until
a thorough investigation.  The medical examiner saying
he hasn't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying
that it isn't there.

While it might end up being true that the FBI had spoken
falsely, it isn't clear yet that they have.

pg. 18, col. 1, Editorial page  
	""Judgment at Waco""

	Now the scientific and political scrutiny of the
horror show in Waco begins, though nothing can
undo the tragedy that might have been prevented 
there.
	Forensic experts will study the rubble and
ashes of the Branch Davidian compound, where at
least 85 people, including 24 children, perished in
smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of
a manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN
JUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.
   [emphasis added by me]
	Investigators will re-create conditions at the
compound and identify accelerants and other fac-
tors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit.
	But the public must question why agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper-
ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve
the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury.
	The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen-
tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal
delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious-
ness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of
arms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of
rationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-
confsesed ""sinner without equal.""
	What continues to mystify are th eactions of
federal agents, who bungled the case from the
start.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when
100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent
on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-
ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-
bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier
oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the
complex had not been adequately explored.
	Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that
those deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into 
the siege there was no public outcry to storm the
compound.
	It had been correctly perceived that the chil-
dren inside ""Rancho Apocalypse"" were essentially 
hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no
reason for the government to be impatient.  The
government's superior firepower, control of water
and utilities and freedom of movement created the
conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.
	Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the
FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for
abandondoning the course of patience.
	If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was
growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-
cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an
M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-
ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they
would have to be weighted against the potential for
eve ngreated hamr.


etc etc tec....
[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]

But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,
and inexperienced president who did not pay
enough attention to the life-and -death decisions
being made on WAco.
	If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would
be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-
forcement officers--a common problem among
prosecutors.
	Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must
be conducted by both the executive and legislative
branches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze 
started.  Though apportioning blame will play a 
role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies
to elude the fire next time.

Wait a minute.  The story being pushed here is that the fire started
in ONE PLACE.  This is not consistent with the story that they were
TRAPPED by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
had many more exits).

Choose one, please.

Well, for everyone besides Koresh and his blood children, we can 
assume independent choice: Ah, they chose to stay in the face of
an assault which clearly endangered their lives.  Or, alternatively,
they were not permitted to leave.  Choose one.

The Waco Quiz

What would you do in the following hypothetical situations?

You have committed no crime.  The BATF conducts a ""no-knock"" raid.
a) Hands in air. Say ""Do you have a warrant?"" Think of hefty suit settlement.
b) Say ""You have 1 second to identify yourself as a cop or I shoot.""
c) Shoot.  Heck, at least in federal prison you might get to have sex.

You have killed federal agents. They blast strange music at you.
a) Come out with hands up. ""I wish to turn state's evidence."" Hope deal's good.
b) Wait, figuring other federal agents will get bored and go on vacation.
c) Wait. If they come after you there will be a chance to kill MORE g-men.

The FBI has you surrounded, asks you to come out immediately.
a) Come out, figuring long prison term is chance to catch up on some writing.
b) Stall. You just can't concentrate when you're on trial for some reason.
c) Decide to write novel-length prophecy now while ideas are fresh in mind.

FBI calls and says they will use tear gas if you don't come out.
a) Come out with hands up. Your radical bro-in-law hated getting gassed at UC.
b) Get out your gas mask. Really, these feds will have to give up eventually.
c) Shoot at vehicles delivering tear gas. It's rude to break down a man's door!

FBI calls and says they will use tanks to break down your walls.
a) Come out with your hands up. Flimsy cardboard construction won't last long.
b) With presence of mind, move flammable devices away from tinder-dry haybales.
c) Spread some kerosene around and hit a match. Big Schwarzenegger ending.

Points are awarded in the following manner: 0 points for every (a) answer,
-1 points for every (b) answer, and -2 points for every (c) answer.
Count 'em up and compare with your friends!

If you answered (a) all the time, you are probably in jail, but alive.
If you answered (b) all the time, you may still be holed up in your compound.
If you answered (c) all the time, you are probably dead.

I agree, I saw no reason they could not have had ""close in"" pool

No crime, irrelevant either way.

Ah yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap.
Always a wise course of action when you're being gassed.

I don't believe there was a ""suicide pact"".  I believe that Koresh
wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.
In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories.

Yes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where
did they expect to go?

The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost
as bad as running into a fire.

Hm, an interesting notion.  We'll see.

More Bible study, no doubt.  Hey, it's a *priority*.

Actually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and
he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims.  We'll know
more later.  In any event, it's irrelevant.

For six hours they were trapped?  The building was not ""destroyed"" 
immediately.  They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME.

Six hours to move it away.  Or COME OUT.

Irrelevant, anyway.  PR one way or the other, but no crime or innocence

No word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative

Right.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at 
any point, and you leave a COLEMAN LANTERN BURNING.  Near BALES OF HAY.

It's ultimately irrelevant who ""lit"" the fire.  They had ample opportunity
to LEAVE.

Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend
to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators.  (Ex.: Ted Bundy.)

Medical assistance was jsut a phone call away.  Gee, all he had to do
was COME OUT.

Not relevant to any crimes.

While he was there.  Anyway, outsiders RARELY see abuse.  It's a secretive
thing.  All we have to go on are the court documents in the Jewell case
and the mistrial in California.

I have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS.

If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would
have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not
IRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to
shoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside.

Just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
weapon at him, I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this case.

Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that
talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the
Second Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out 
of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active

Basic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a ""right of the people

""right of a militia to keep and bear arms,"" or a ""right of well-regulated

For the other arguments, I suggest you check out the thread, ""Some more

How about a gun buy-back/charity?  Get some sponsors to fund the
purchase of used firearms, have a gunsmith check them over, and give
or sell them at a low price to poor persons wishing to own firearms. ;-)

OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you
know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.
You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed
individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family
against this attack b) realize ""oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I 
better surrender"" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do
what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you 
defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your
door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to 
charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that
you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological 
warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up
and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still
holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using
tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that
you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest
round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as
cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through
the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created
by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.

I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with
the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to 
surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency
committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted
search warrant.  

Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements
regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered
trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire
which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now 
playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of 
Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses
by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been
held off in their assault.

What if.......

What if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out;
at least the mothers and the children, so they (the FBI) did not
bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......

What if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using
tear gas......(let`s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices)

What if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
building, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......

What if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the
Davidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they (the FBI) had
killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......

What if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians
made it out.......?????

  If they had been quiet there would have been no deaths??  I thought thier
neighbors said that the Davidians never bothered them.  Oh, well, that couldn't
have been your point, then.  

  If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the ATF wouldn't have felt 
threatened and had to move in.  Here's a newsflash:  It isn't illegal to
own more than one firearm.  It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms.
 
  They shot federales?  The feds shot them, too.  

  How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes
the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.  Since
they were so nice to the Davidians the first time round, I can see why
the Davidians didn't surrender so easily, especially because they were
expecting the end of the world.

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.

       While I wouldn't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got
to be paranoid based on either Usenet in general or Phill Hallam-Baker's
comments in general, you'd be surprised.
 
       For most people, if you accuse them of something long enough and
loud enough, to enough people, they start to ask why they're bothering
to fight it.
 
       If nothing you do will be considered right, why bother to do right?
It's pretty basic human nature.

       What an amazing thing.  I didn't realize that over a hundred million
gun owners all posted to tpg.
 
       Even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what
you say they illustrate, it would still only reflect the written
personas (which is often different from face-to-face) of a very, very
small and select group.
 
       Anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on
Usenet to the general population of any country either doesn't care
about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.
 
>USEnet as a whole
>disproves it of humanity as a whole.
 
        Speaking of which...
 
      Most of the ""readership"" posts I've seen put the most read
newsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number I have a feeling is
fairly inflated.  The posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a
very tiny minority of that group.  And the whole of Usenet readers
are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.
 
       If anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative
sample of Usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too
much time available to us.

        Phill, if you really believe that the various posts on

I have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality.
 
        But don't expect you really do believe that.  It's simply
a convenient way to make your point, and hopefully make those

I'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against
the Davidians by the FBI/BATF. Here is what I've got so far. Care to add
any or provide more backup info?

First Amendment:
1) FBI/BATF violated Davidians right to free exercise of religion from the 
	start. We now have a de facto precident against any minority religion.
2) FBI/BATF violated BD right to free speach by:
	a> preventing them to speak to media
	b> preventing them from practicing their beliefs
3) FBI/BATF violated the freedom of the press by:
	a> keeping them 2 miles from the Davidians
	b> preventing the media to cover the FBI/BATF actions close-up
	c> censoring media reports
4) FBI/BATF violated the BD's right to peaceable assemble
	a> proven by initial baseless assault

Second Amendment:
1) The BATF went after them because they had too many guns and guns that the
	FBI/BATF didn't approve of. 'Nuff Said.

Fourth Amendment:
1) The right of the BD's to be ""secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
   effects against unreasonable searches and seizures"" was violated by:
	a> Initial baseless assault

Fifth Amendment:
1) The Davidians were ""held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
   crime"" without a ""presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury.""
2) The Davidians were ""deprived of life, liberty, and property without due 
   process of law.

Sixth Amendment:
1) The accused were denied the right to ""a speedy and public trial by an
   impartial jury"" when the FBI became judge, jury and executioner.
2) The BD's were never informed of the specific ""nature anad cause of the
   accusation.""

Eighth Amendment:
1) The Davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when:
	a> The FBI cut off the water to the ranch
	b> The FBI used Psy-War (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of
	   dying rabbits and Tibetian Chants)
	c> The FBI prevented family members from contacting their family
	   inside the ranch.
	d> The FBI used tear-gas against them (especially the children)
	e> The FBI burned the ranch down.
	f> Thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a hearing.

Anything I miss?

At least you're consistent.  I'm sure the highly propagandized Germans
tended to believe their government's version too in the thirties and
forties as those ""different"" highly demonized Jewish ""cultists"" met

I understand fire trucks had been at the site for several weeks but were

So who brainwashed YOU into believing that whatever the government says it
the truth?  Or that Koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the 
US?  Haven't you ever stopped to wonder WHY the government raided this farm?
This raid was NOT ABOUT RELIGION, SEX, OR CHILD ABUSE.  To the best available
evidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was 
about Koresh's failure to PAY A $200 TAX on ONE grenade launcher that he may 
or may not even have had!  That's why it was the BATF doing the raiding in the
first place.

Do you think a $200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government
with 100 armed men in trailers, orchestrated character assassination, noise
torture, and a holocaust?

Hmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.

When the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)
shotgun and pistol you mention we had:

 - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
 - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
   by civilians).
 - breech-loading rifles

In addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented
and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so.

Sounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
Uzi, semi- or full-auto?

>Just because someting was good once, does not mean it will be forever.

Until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,
either private or government, which should be defended against), there's
no reason it should go away.

That includes suicides.  Since it has been shown in other countries that
suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for
doing oneself in (studies include some done/published in Japan, Canada,
Austria, Norway), suicides ought not be included in the count.

If this is done, the number of vehicle-related deaths greatly exceeds that
of firearms-related deaths in Texas.

Certainly not.

Why?  Unless it's doing something that directly hurts someone else, what's
the point?  (Otherwise, you'd better stop operating all motor vehicles, since
the price of operating them *greatly* exceeds the cost in lives of firearms.

>One state (don't remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could

WEll, it's been done at least twice.  South (North?) Carolina did it a few
years back...and watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country
rise quite a bit.

Virginia just passed the law...no word yet on what the results will be, but
I'd be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates won't be one of them.

>I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on
>other people.

Self-defense doesn't ""inflict"" on other people (except perhaps the criminal
who's tried to do you damage, and maybe indirectly on future potential victims
who might not become victims).

Just want to make a comment on this.  If you live in this country long
enough, you should realize the media is no friend of the govt.  I am
only concerned about fact that the media like to jump to conclusion
before the facts.  But I am sure they are good in digging dirt as

make news.

The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough
to do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to
the FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these
organizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try
to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken
gun.
 
There have been postings stating that law enforcement should be
divided and and weak.  But there is nothing more dangerous to
liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to
chase.  The ATF is one and look at the trouble it started in
Waco.

Oh, you mean something like moving the press back to a single

CNN reported tonight that some bodies were found with bullet holes in their
heads.  However, I have no information on the possible causes.

This is not to say that Government stories are to be taken at the face value in
this case, but to jump to conclusion at this stage may be the source of
embarrassment in the future.  Let's be paranoic, this may be a ploy to smoke
out the opposition and decredit them.  :-)

Comparison of this incidence to Tienanmen Square is made in soc.culture.china.

Now, notice, it says *arms*.  Not guns.  Arms.

I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they 
intended to do, ""orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and
a holocaust"" would never have come to pass.

The BD's killed members of the BATF on the first day. ""Orchestrated character

Drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same
direction.  Pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge
from miles around.  Throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will
depart.

Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no
actual conspiracy is required.

Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he
quickly covers his ass.

This, too, is completely natural.

It looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it's NOT 
the first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent
one ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public
as this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  Maybe this 
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
residences in this manner.  But probably not.

For those who didn't figure it out, the below message was a reply to another
in sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. I
didn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused.

The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.

However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet
another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I
disagree both with the interpretation of ""well-regulated"" in the Second
Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of
the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my
reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control,
and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a
special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference
in which ""well regulated"" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and
not under control/disciplined, etc.

Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not
an 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many
do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular
forum.

To avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that I've come in here
to post this one message, just to clarify the one below. I'm now outta here
again though I'm available via e-mail.

A really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  It
claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the U.S.
I understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before
May 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  Is
Texas one of those states?

Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been 
killed by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S.?

And finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest
of facts on the Waco incident.  In particular, I would like a source
for the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and
information on the beginning of the raid, specifically BATF
lies.

I am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead
to personal and property damage against innocent citizens.

I intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.  The author
of the piece states he wants to work for the BATF.  gack!

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves,
but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about
three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards 
you can't just ""shut it off"" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 
hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.

So it ain't exactly ""light up the stove and cook me a batch of them 
pancakes, Aunt J...""  If you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for
heating your house at night, you will have it lit to SOME extent all 
the time.  Trust me on this one, I speak from experience.

Hey, guys.  You're absolutely correct, and well on the way to winning
this battle ... and losing the war.  Yes, there are serious philosophical
flaws in HR 1276.  Technical ones, too -- how'd you like to sue the Feds,

Still, I have one basic question:  compared to what we've _got_ is HR 1276

Imagine, you have been under seige for almost two months by an enemy which you
believe wants to kill you.  Suddenly, they pump tear gas into your building and
punch holes in it with tanks.  Then a fire breaks out.  Do you run outside to
be slaughtered, or stay and face your fate.

Today the Texas ME found two people, a man and a woman shot in the head
inside the burned compound. But these were not the people that the FBI
described a few days before. The FBI said that the person found in front of
the compound had been shot and several children were also. The two people
found today were on top of the main inside concrete bunker that provided
the most protection during the fire. So the comment that children were
shot is still not proved.

I just heard on CNN that the Texas Rangers found an M60 machine gun
in the BD compound Rubble.  The newscaster called this a new hi-tech

M60 semi-auto, or that it was leagally owned and the tax was paid.

What year was the M60 patented?

Okay.  I have my copies of all relevant gun-control bills.  I'm mad as hell.

Who do I write?

Who should I concentrate on writing my comments to?  The actual author of the

I don't believe that I will change the world, but at least I am going to throw

But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never
manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their
laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally.

Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION
licensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of
licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX.
Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year.

Does passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY
obeying laws pay any dividents?

So far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators.

See, this is what I call the ""argument from religion:"" ""I believe.""  Don't
believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history
of countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to
whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER
after.  (Don't look at ""violent gun crimes,"" that's begging the question.)
You may be very surprised.

> If ALL crimes done with guns stopped AND all accidents also stopped or
> was reduced to a minimum THEN I would consider lifting all gun control.

You have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of
strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.
However, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent 
crime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.  Think about it.

So far, none of the stats show any improvement...

Do you really think driver's tests are any indication of your propensity
for having accidents?  

I've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while 
drunk; after having been up all night; with two fighting kids in the 
back seat; with a hot cup of coffee on their lap; or while putting on 
makeup, reading the newspaper, or talking on their cellular phone.  
But that's what they're doing when they have those accidents.

""Well Regulated"", at the time of its writing and in the context of the Second Amendment,
means ""Properly trained and equipped.""

It modern language it would read:

funny, if Koresh did say that, he was quoting St. Paul. of course, 
the early Christians were persecuted too. if Koresh is a loony 
because he quotes the Bible, how long is it before mainstream 
Christians become the target of the FBI's loving care and attention?

Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes? Bullets go flying every
where. IMHO, these ""gunshot wounds"" were actually caused when the magazines 
went up. A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make, so I'll wait for an
autopsy to determine if they were shot first. 

Either way, they're all dead and the FBI & Atty. Gen. Vampria are still
responable.

They finally realize that they need to put criminals away
longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun
law.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how
easy criminals get off ) 
In the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law

If in said situation. I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported
on in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action
is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a 
weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)
and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile 
action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)
Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking
gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and
I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's
 ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's
practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)
IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER
WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not
bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a
Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)
call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on 
the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will
use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and
that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none
came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded
with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special
purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing
lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you
fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can
think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the
Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose
and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.
(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not 
ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often
cross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with
one shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court.
Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were.
Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the
same questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see
if your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification
and weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your
 politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are
required in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to
hold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one,
contact the NRA. They have a legal assistance fund.(Or at least they used to)
I DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER! (Not my business either way though..) If I was
vague on anything, or I left some questions unanswered, you can E-MAIL
me or post here. (Preferebly E-MAIL. I don't have a load of time to review

James, it could be that they were determined to stay together in the compound
no matter what happened. Perhaps the fire was accidental, and the DB simply
refused to leave the compod. Perhap they died fighting the fire? who knows.

in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the
chemical weapons treaty.

The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in
wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including 
nnocent children.

For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George
Stephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations.
(When questioned about it, his reply was that the treaty did
not forbid its internal use by law enforcement agencies.

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.

Not necessarily. If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due
to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.
In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of
meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up
such scenes. 

As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the
time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the
evidence. Texas Rangers are not pathologists.

                         THE LIES OF TEXAS

Okay, what have we learned?

For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known 
-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative 
committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard
of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and 
personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the 
First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to 
the Constitution. 

The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw 
agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own 
losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his 
electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside 
world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in 
pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency 
finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit 
eager to gain credit for ""straightening out the mess"" -- and, more 
importantly, to script his side of the subsequent ""negotiations"" 
any way they please. 

The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time 
four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a 
single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. 
Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers 
using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious 
records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive 
those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority 
will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean 
Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). 

Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising 
of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house 
and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and 
is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, 
including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. 

Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the 
President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: 
blame the victim. 

He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a 
secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being 
""examined"" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children 
-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. 
He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 
3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that 
Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to 
embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was 
severed at the start of the whole travesty. 

A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe 
that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow 
responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever 
know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound 
more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? 

Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never 
forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and 
rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, 
it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which 
may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage 
and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) 
about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a 
mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. 

More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower 
of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance 
as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the 
system, then at least within yourself. 

On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of 
the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw 
agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised 
in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both 
agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped 
to write that plank. 

True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 
1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone 
in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their 
behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what 
happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, 
Waco never would have happened. 

Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough 
of political parties more interested in collecting and holding 
power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human 
life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe 
the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less 
tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

Think about it.

NO SURRENDER!
Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993

It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel
threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are
immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid
of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The
stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the
house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The
mugger...the rapist. 

And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door
locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and
always, there's the implied question ""what's a pretty little thing like
you doing without a husband around to protect you?

But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10
years to devote learning judo?

What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that ""rape victims
using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -
and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any
other form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for
robbery/assault)(Kleck,123) 

What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend
on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a
crime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that
the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the
whole community.

As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice
themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to
help themselves?

Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says
""no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-
pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out."" But if
a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient
means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.
""Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!"" they ask. How could you
hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from
you. In truth, 1% of ""defensive gun uses"" result in the offender taking
the gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)

Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already
made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be
victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more
guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching
others, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are
preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.
We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're
going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE
INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.

But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more
secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.

That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that
governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed
people. It's the way they survive.

In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people
both at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and
threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -
what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides
""it's for your own safety"" or ""we know best"". Any person who acted
like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his
life and locked up as a habitual offender.

But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who
should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt
me? Then why did you file your income tax? 

Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something
that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's
really after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're
after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,
Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for
our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. 

As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices
given to women: to surrender or to fight. 

Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the
disappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. 

A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep
the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if
they have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:
""the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.""

As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will
do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,
and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always
remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it
can lead to Tiananmen Square. 

When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep
them from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,
I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter
what laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more
substantial in my hand than a brick. 

My opinions are, of course, my own.

If you won't believe anything the government says, and the press

In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with
people from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults
operate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave
the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing
with cults and similar organizations.

------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------

I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included
cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external
reading too).

William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of
""evil"" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,
University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what
would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,
and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think
the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced
..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I
think they're onto something.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
		How cult psychology works...
	[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]

So long as Koresh could ""own"" his people, he made sure they didn't
believe there was any life out there for them, away from him.
Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians
recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived
only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.
Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they
believed him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even
the Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left
him, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces
of the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)
couldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die
too, like the folks in Jonestown.

For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife
(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then
themselves.  That's the consequence of shattered ""cultism.""  It really
does happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such
cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no
matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]

...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]

I agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good
(?)  reasons for news blackouts.

>	The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  
>	yesterday, those people would be alive today.

 ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh
made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.
Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He
held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing
would really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!

Look at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,
at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once
Jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his
entourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd
be busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought
up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are
tapes...  The ""logic"" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it
wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people
who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by
THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the
same with the Branch Davidians.
(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER
WHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)

...
The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate
reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying
full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the
off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...

So, the only way the BATF/FBI could ""save"" those people, and future
cults, is by ignoring such signs.

I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him
into letting them go, or somehow influencing ""his"" people to abandon
him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.
... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that
with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe
they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's
certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.

...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]

    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from
Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.

    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd
want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning
boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_
playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at
checkmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.

...

I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you
deny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and
the rest of the gummint should exist at all.

Um, I sortof hesitate to bring this up, but owning even a single share
entitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting, and under most
corporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed.  While I *don't*
suggest the tactic used by some in Japan (go to the shareholders meeting,

	My god, a sane person!  Somebody asking intelligent questions rather
than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi
Germany.  I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF.
There are some definite questions needing answers.

>1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at
>some time before the Feb. 28th raid?

	Probably.  Which is why there are so many people angry at the
initial confrontation.  Why attack a compound with as many people in that
compound who are willing to die for their leader?  Further, they attacked
in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  That
was rather stupid...

>2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

	This I doubt.  While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single
exception of the psychological ""warfare"" by blaring music, etc.  I think
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.

>3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the ""right"" course of action?

	See above...

I suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word
""release"" is peculiar.  Let's say you and your family are besieged

Relay of coverage seen:
----------------------
There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier 
today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found 
on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained 
to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer 
turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous 
by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  

The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and 
the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  
It was also emphasized that the survey of the ""crime"" scene at this 
point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.
The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the 
site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  

That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my 
memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it 
and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will 
probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.

My opinions:
-----------
I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely 
responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the 
last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the 
aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.

Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are 
already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court 
case seems overblown to me.

It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also 
heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government 
enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good 
idea in previous months.

Please also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many 
conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual, 
I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered 
by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO.  As such, 
my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

The FBI, CIA, BATF, etc. ARE federal agencies, you are correct.  But to
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and
that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then
tell the Prez, who says, ""I knew all along"".  While this may not seem right,
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after
all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and
maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if
they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses
are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority
religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of
cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do
not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is
digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are
associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about
would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt
BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was
unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S
government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President
Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives
should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from
reaching its full potential.

  You are correct WRT the idea of some heating being nice that morning.  But 
part of that line was also for the guy who said ""minutes later, the fires
started"".  I did forget how cool it was that day.

  BUT...  Suppose they had waited.  The WORST outcome would have been the
one that actually did.  But with the FBI/ATF just standing there watching
instead of being a part of the problem.  It then would have been very clear
exactly who was at fault then, rather than the way it turned out.

  But what does it matter?  Why say ""I don't remember...."" when it doesn't
make any difference?  Altho the clintonettes have been pretty good at lying
when it wasn't necessary, they didn't do it this time.  But it wasn't 
necessary - claiming full responsibility is a totall meaningless gesture.
Symbolism over substance - again!

    CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN

    With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists
    that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the
    same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re-
    moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's
    new CrimeStrike project, engineered by Arizona's former chief assist-
    ant attorney general Steven J. Twist.

    CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily
    crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,
    including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is
    applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and
    staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is
    primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the
    rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.

    Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.

    The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun
    control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek
    reasonable regulation of firearms.

    But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear
    need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-
    countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.

    When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-
    Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars
    to getting criminals off the street.

    We say, welcome to town.

I keep hearing this, and while I'll agree that he ""should"" have come
out (legally, that was his best option), he didn't; and as far as I know,
there is no legal provision for ""we're tired of this shit, lets just
kick some ass...""

So I have a question for you; here goes.

I come up to you and point a gun at you, saying ""I'm going to count
to ten, if you aren't standing on your head by then, I'll kill you.""
You believe that standing on your head is the road to damnation, so
you don't do it.
""1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10...BANG!""  You are now dead - Is it my
fault for shooting you, or you're fault for being shot?
Koresh wouldn't stand on his head.

Okay, here is the result of my efforts.  I'm just getting started with this
type of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.

Comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.

****************************************************************************

Editor, 

I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to
the ""right to keep and bear arms"", and to a greater degree, the many other
""rights"" that we take for granted on a daily basis. 

1.	You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You
call the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while
you are waiting for the police to arive? 

2.	You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A ""good
samaritan"" stops to ""help"", when you find you and your family at gun-point or
knife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? 

3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears
suddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you
strong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape
you in order to survive the attack? 

If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep
and bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun
may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going
to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to
defend yourself and your family? 

Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If
certain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm
ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law
enforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition
for use in your handgun. 

There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel
that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for
the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?

Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,
or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while
waiting for help to arrive. 

There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit
the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One
elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! 

I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected
officials decided that they should only belong to a ""certain church"", or go to
church on a ""partiular day""?  What if you were told that you could only read
certain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the
right to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful
manner? 

These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.
If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight
for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life
is affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by
defending your Second Amendment rights.

	Very narrow.  Very, very narrow.  If you'll recall, I was the

weapons in certain situations.  How can you possibly define what is a
weapon and what isn't is only the start of this.

	And you've just described any civilian reactor because your
definition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors
blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes
from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See
what a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just
north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the
sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision
reactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the
PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor
itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can
be made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is
flawed in a few respects already.

	Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If
you don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this
bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of
spreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits
this definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild.

	And I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example,
perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide
is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can
be used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for
making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a
toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that
it can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance.
So, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I
still have those pesky gophers.

>I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for

	The basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not
in writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and
extended beyond the point where it does any good.

	It meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that
can be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,
and despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers
supply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass
destruction is rather a given.

	It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not
see a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly
impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some
pretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for
abuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old
standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to
be added to, generally without going through the hassles of another
vote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse.

For those of you still unsure whether this is satire, the jury is still out:

    ""Also yesterday, even though the compound no longer exists, the
     US attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents,
     including a search warrant and related affidavits, that authorities
     planned to use when the siege was over.

    ""These documents did not include the original warrants the Bureau of
     Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had in late February, which to this

    ""...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek
     samples of Koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had
     signed for some gun purchases, but also that he espoused
     'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly
     the ATF.'""

So, one of the charges against Koresh seems to be Contempt of Cop -- he
expressed hostility to the BATF.  That chilly feeling in your gonads is 
perfectly normal, folks... it should go away in about 51 days.

        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

That should save them the trouble of subpoena-ing samples.  Heavens knows

	I'd bet cash 90% of the people couldn't find the window after six
minutes!  Ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military.  It is
not at all uncommon for a few soldiers who have not properly attached
and cleared their masks to require assistance exiting the chamber.  Since

Subject: Don Kates' talk on the Branch Davidians
Organization: Ideology Busters, Inc.
Keywords: Kates
Lines: 110

This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:

I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk
at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy
conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough
summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as
exactly what he actually said...

Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not
discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.

Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This
isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has
been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel
hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to
people like Koresh.

Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.
There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.
Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they
called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for
protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were
changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many
small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not
large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the
FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they
were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).
""All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that
power.""

The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid
illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners
no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills
disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its
existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.
Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media
is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a
pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but
if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents
removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in
chains.

The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for
review.

Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and
that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot
at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100
agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had
some medical personnel on hand.

He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest
in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on
the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and
the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could
be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns
back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached
rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.

The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they
audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his
followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and
they reacted accordingly.

With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates
was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that
the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their
informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had
more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been
completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to
knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for
thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,
then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns
down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF
breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the
Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served
warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A
close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_
have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was
the first shot fired!

The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial
position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held
off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was
beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the
public's sympathy.

Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,
diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents
like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,
well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have
even more tragic results.

PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston
College Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or
place, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that
information.

Interesting development.  Especially since the Feds (and the U.N.)

citizens as well.  Hmmm...  Republican Guard/Iraqu Army = FBI/BATF?

On TV news this morning it was reported that the local Texas authorities
who have reviewed the cases of the 21 children who were released
earlier in the siege have found no evidence of physical or sexual
abuse of any of the children.  I don't recall if this was on Good
Morning America or our local Texas TV station.

      I can understand the first screwed-up raid by the BATF.  They
underestimated the opposition, which happens.  But not this one.  
The FBI had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time 
for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.  
They still botched it.

      The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign,
or be fired for incompetence.

      I don't blame Reno or Clinton.  They gave the FBI clear orders:
don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that,
wait it out.  Those were reasonable orders.  The FBI said they could
pull off a tactical solution, and they couldn't.

   For the moment, forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris.  Did
anybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up
a .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these.  (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)

  So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:

1.   A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)

2.   A ban on ""sniper rifles""

3. A ban on ""stockpiling"" guns and ammunition.


BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on
     the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.

Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges.
They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID
impound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED.

Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not
federal.  The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably,
and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process.

So maybe the best way for BATF/FBI to save people is to mind their 
own fucking business.

Funny, Brent, but so far we have heard two versions of the ""facts:""

1) What the government says.  This includes what the government says that
   two survivors have said.

2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says,
   including what he says that most of the survivors have said.

Strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.

If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in.  I may have missed it.
But my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
case 2, and not at all like case 1.

	Why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately?  The NRA
is an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame
to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a
lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes.  Mention

rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to
a crisp.  See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were
quite dead.  Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.

	However, it's my contention that it makes little difference
whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem
to have shared responsibility for both.

They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a
shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.

Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides,
the ranch house (not ""fort apocalypse""; it was just a house despite what
the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The ""Gun loonies"" couldn't hardly
have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.
The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there
to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*
under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't
even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that
the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in
this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.
Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.

Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media
and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it
up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American
people will probably believe them.

This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that
is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns
*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On
the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal
guns then the government did have the right to search their compound.
But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons
hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke
any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this
is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.
The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol
violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should
stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of
their jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.

Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults
alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are ""heavily-armed
religious wackos"".

David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out
peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON
THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE
LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.

Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the
cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that
it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on
fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions
of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.
Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED
EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still
don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the
Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.

You're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They
had MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic
pistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later
retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.

Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in
Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then
they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns
me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government
seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are
becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  This
greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.

Who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit ""opinion poll"" of ""most

""Freed om of Religion"" has absolutely nothing to do with building a small

I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because
he grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego.

That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds.

This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the
stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one,
but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I
expected this to happen.

Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was
coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower

If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is
""just"" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't
have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I
was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968
8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be
moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked
my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face
felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after
exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a
dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I
doubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through
it.

When did Koresh go on a rampage?

What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th.

Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion
to anything reasonable.

And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled
believe the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe
Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack.

I suppose they also believed things like:
""I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget.""
""We don`t need to lead with a tax increase....""
""It starts with a middle-class tax cut...""
""I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll
have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history.""
""I will ask congress for a line item veto..""
""I will lift the social security earnings test..""

I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves
right, rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than
50% chance of being right about my first guess!

Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens
and their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power.

As Tom Jefferson said:
""When all government,..., shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of
all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government
on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government
from which we separated.""  (1821)

 Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.
What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?
I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.

 My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police

 Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
or the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see
that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that
400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access
to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between
1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the ""statistics"".

 Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.  I meant that to put children in a
situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
act of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over
these children directly, but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is
would not let innocent children die.
If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive?  Thanks for the reality check Joe, its been real.

So if it turns out that the fire WAS caused by a tank knocking over a

Or will you find then find a different reason to hang it all on Koresh?

I seem to recall graphic news file of buddhist monks setting themselves on fire
in the streets of Saigon. Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not
so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to 
carry it through. And, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of 
the bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had
less constitutional fortitude. Then again, maybe the FBI ran in while the fire
was raging, executed those two, and ran out again.

Firearm?  Let's not even consider long knives (swords), which were also
common militia weapons in the 18th century, and which, if anything, are
often restricted more heavily than firearms.  Whatever sense gun control
makes, knife control makes even less.

You seem to make two points.  No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies  
you mention, and since Koresh ""apparently"" has a different view point from your  
Baptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious  
persecution.  As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all?

Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.

Baptists are a cult, two, BTW, under most of the definitions in the dictionary  
of ""cult"".

Rember, Korash didn't get to sort this all out, serenely typing at his
keyboard.  He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being
ATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh,
its ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at
that point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear
of his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have
you ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, under
that pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate
what is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'law
enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For
all we know, he was informed by someone saying something like ""Hey,
guy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you...""

According to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) said
the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around
$200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period).
Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a
drug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced
decent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably
has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is
an avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,
nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note
that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what
is the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad
for some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming
the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?
This administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL.
Whether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards,
it all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.  Can you say 1984, only 10 years late?
I knew you could...  :-)

shit, and the FBI taking over to manage things, we see it all turned to
shit, too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH.
Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet
you NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.  'Responsibility' only has
meaning as media PR, or as a means to corner the average Joe Schmoe.

Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end.  Any generators are
no doubt out of fuel, too.  So all they would have is wood stoves and
kerosene lanters (maybe).  It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the
walls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire.  Remember, the FBI
had bugs which they even used (illegally) to eavesdrop on private
conversations with the lawyers.  If a suicide order were given they
WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IN TIME.  If the Feds had been concerned they would
have had emergency equipment ready.  Not an hour or so later, not
leaving the water THEY TURNED OFF, off.  They could have turned it back
on.  They just didn't wanna.  Scores to settle...

I have not made up my mind about Waco, but there sure seems to be a group of  
devoted government following fanatics willing to believe whatever that  
government wants to tell them, without any shred of doubt, nor thought of thier  
own.  They sure get shrill whenever their belief structure is being shaken.

Kinda reminds you of the BDs, doesn't it?

Has anyone publically considered the possibility that the fires were set
for defence instead of suicide and the destruction and confusion caused
by the tanks and gas caused things to get out of the BDs control?

True.

>covered in the above reference.)

No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so
the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder.

Two  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my
reloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was 
about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand
primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20
and .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the 
reloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2"" of char on
the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other
words.

None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.
No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.
The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids
completely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was
contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred
badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case
of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.

Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood
on all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the
rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were
found still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into 
the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually
dislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.
The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.
No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets
left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.

Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless
of what the FBI says.

Last time I checked, ""amassing an arsenal"" and practicing any kind of
religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights.  Guess it's
OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing
a bunch of religious nutcakes, eh?

Of all the idiots I run into in daily life, Dan, your type scare me the
most.  You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief
just as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who
doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and
therefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the
government says is wrong to be wrong.

David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,
methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT
even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe
the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid
to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.
You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others
fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned 
from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice
just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go
my own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,
either individually or collectively as the great socialist ""we"" has ANY 
RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.

You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to
just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound
in order to ""save themselves"".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment
about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if
suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are
beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear
enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct
course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically
designed to force you to make that ""forsake or die"" decision?

The ""forsake or die"" option is exactly what the government forced on the
Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that
first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51
when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and
children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The
people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose
individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who
believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those
people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like
you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with ""well they could
have come out"" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face
were there not a network between us.  You're not worth the ashes of
those people who burned.

No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State.

At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was
slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students
were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two
students who were following and taunting.

The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while
occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.
All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1
Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this
45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with
the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in
the confrontation.

There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently
they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had
conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,
James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known
that he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.

The matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched
a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the
terms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not
identified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).

It was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently
by General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the

They did have the proper equipment.  The problem is that they went about
things the wrong way.  The ATF should have served the warrant in a
peacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of Rambos with
guns blazing.  I'm not trying to excuse what David Koresh did.  I'm
just saying that the ATF (henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops :-)
went about the ""raid"" in an improper manner.

Let the FBI, Customs, and local police officers do the ATF's job.  WE
DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE!!!  The cigarette cops are just leftovers
from Prohibition days.  They are an anachronism!

Including you?  What if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and
cut you in half with a machine gun?  THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.
Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example.
It's happened before and it can happen *again*.  I have heard of more
than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour.  Just recently I
heard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they
thought he had dope or something.  The guy blew both of the officers
away and he didn't go to jail for it.  The judge hearing the case
ruled that the man was acting in self-defense.

Are you sure that that would have been the way to go?  Surely the FBI
and ATF could have handled this fiasco better.  They didn't have to
massacre all those people.  As Stimpy said in ""Fake Dad"", ""Shame, shame,
double shame!""  The FBI and ATF should be ashamed of theirselves.

Jason - I've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as
conspiracy nuts, but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy, at
least at the beginning.  There were a lot of bad decisions that went into
this tragedy, and some people may now be taking some serious evasive
action to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of
those bad decisions.  Actually, the only ones I see that are tied into
a conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with
stockpiles of weapons and suicide pacts.

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that
David Koresh had ""explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air.""  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the
first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas
into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a
fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't
they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or
similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been
saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.

Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that
this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I
don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this
so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.
We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion""
looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,
dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.

Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown
by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they
said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE
THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?
Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the
cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.

What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the
compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,
or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their
face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the
rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the
ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to
make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if
you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here
but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks
had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.
Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents
used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

Well, I don't normally like to quote myself, but I just got some
additional information.  I called my state rep (to express my support),
and the person there informed me that it's actually just a second
reading of the bill (three are required) for further consideration.
I'm not 100% sure what *that* means, and I'm also not sure why
there's a discrepancy between what the two offices are telling me.

Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However,
the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the

I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure. 
According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to public
complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she said
the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I 
strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known.

This is quite corect, but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy
will show virtually no deformation, ie a hollow point probably would not
expand, an FMJ would be ""pristene"".  Also the bullets will not be marked
with the lands ang grooves of a barrel, because they didn't come out of
one.  A good pathologist should be able to notice this right away.

Let us hope that the  ME's that handle these bodies are more competent
then the ones who did JFK's body.

I don't know about the paranoia and irrationality, but the rest is
pretty close, all though you left out the inability to breath.  Of
course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged
things to get away from it.  I've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill

What they didn't mention is that IN THE OPEN, it probably wouldn't do
TOO MUCH harm to children, although I wouldn't use it in close proximity
to infants.  On the other hand, IN CONFINED spaces, the effects are
GREATLY intensified, to the point of LETHALITY, since a sufficient
quantity of CS will displace OXYGEN.  When running a CS chamber CAREFUL
attention is paid to ventilation.  I wonder if they checked to see if
any of the BDs were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory
diseases.  I doubt it.

Subject: BATF & FBI Do Right Thing in Waco
Lines: 44

Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to 
understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than
what we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ?

BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending
budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big
commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab
Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no
propaganda value there. 

The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed
the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the
BDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. 

The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined
that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their
little 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on
the BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should
have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the
BDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like
the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have
obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to
do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies
to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest
of us - at the voting booth. 

If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have
become that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to
vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years,
we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When
the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem
to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is
raiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand.
When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the
public doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in
the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out
of shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow.

Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious
fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't
blame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within
the parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'.

	What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire
	upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at
	first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they
	did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies
	do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey
	or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us,
	they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal
	wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad.
	If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply
	for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant
	then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get
	to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend
	that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction
	within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by
	US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)

	Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and
	the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and
	his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco.
	The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a
	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big
	commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be
	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the
	other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did.
	Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and
	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that
	take root. 

	The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again,
	the laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created
	them, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and
	the FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters have
	allowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana -
	militarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated
	violence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay
	for, or vote for, and this was the result of many choices
	we have made over the years. Don't blame 'them' - blame

OB ill-wind-and-all-that:  with Bill the Prez in there, at least the

Speaking of ME's. The FBI said the fire victims were found face-up
<fire victims, apparently, are usually found face down> 
suggesting they died prior to the fire. The ME says, in a word,
BULLSHIT, the victims WERE face down. The FBI says they sent a body
of a victim that was shot, supposedly by BD guards, the ME
says, in a word, BULLSHIT, the body showed NO evidence of gunshot
wounds. Can the ATF/FBI tell the difference between CYA and truth?

I did read the law before I commented on it.  Judging from replies I received
about my ""Semantics on t.p.g"" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g
assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the
possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said
person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or
business.

>-andy
>--

Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing
that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying
a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their
person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many
people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.
Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above
quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I
am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether
or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that
I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.
Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he
seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.
I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is
useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now
is that Freeman and I are ""running around in circles"" trying to prove each
other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course
now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier
posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky
about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some-
times.

(sic) Oh, you're really bright. As if nobody would have understood it was a
typo.

Several parents with children who either had at one time or currently were
inside the compound made the aforementioned charges. One parent actually
spoke about said charges (in reference to his 13-year old daughter) WITH
Koresh on the phone.

You missed my point entirely.

Anti-social. Normally meaning a response against societal norms. Stealing

Of course not. There's more than a little difference between formulating

group of religious fanatics. Why do people compare apples and oranges?

and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.
The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student
(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...

(The title was the only thing they changed/added)

""Gun Stats""

The Daily recently reprinted an article from the
Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton
Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,
in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The
article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This
is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-
eral reasons, outlined below:

The study gives the impression that, if you own a
gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you.  The study, however, fails to take into
account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun
to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-
trator.

The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every
month, the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a
friend.

The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample
size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-
stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.

Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-
erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be
used, successfully, by a private citizen against an
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.
Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-
rate conclusion from them.

And you shouldn't, as the matches kill more kids.  So why are you bleating

No, that's not right either.  People who have both easy access and the
desire to kill, kill people.  Considering that people who have the
desire to kill turn that into easy access ....  (Haven't you folks
learned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs?)

If you don't affect the desire, you're wasting your time, not to
mention the other costs incurred.

Good for them.  I note that the TM folks make the same argument.  If
you'll pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city),
they promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc.  At least
they're not promising to jail me if I don't go along with their little
plan - they're going to just sit in a room and fly, leaving me alone.

Ah, but we have evaluated gun control using before-after and it
doesn't work to reduce crime.  What is the point?  We can't claim that
it is symbolic, as people do get jailed.

>The police are
>essentially saying ""look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't

No, they're essentially saying ""we hope this will keep you from

resources isn't ""caring"".

Nope, you'll merely be ignored, as Wright, Rossi, and Daly were after

So, who gassed them?  Given their previous experience with thugs who
threw grenades before yelling ""we're from the govt and we're here to

interests at heart?  Would you ""know"" that the gas was ""non-lethal""?

Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it
is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding
the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported
by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While
this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not
propel the bullet with any significant velocity.

In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded
cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough
to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.

Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause
slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.

As David Veal points out, this sort of ""promotion"" would be used
against gun owners by the mass media.

However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,
free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40
or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.

Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished
teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been
very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices
interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but
feel they should know something about ""gun safety"" since members
of their family keep guns at home.

Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:

(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases
    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.

(2) A ""gun safety"" class is Politically Correct, and likely to
    be viewed positively by the public and the media.

(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)
    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a
    gentle introduction to firearms.

(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun
    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.

(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners
    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,
    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate
    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun
    students sometimes tell us they have ""something new to think
    about"" with regards to personal gun ownership.

(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.

Our course is the standard NRA-certified ""Home Firearm Safety""
class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also
teach the NRA's ""Personal Protection"" class, although the cost
is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.

I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to
gun buy-backs.

        The voting booth is highly over-rated.  People need to get up

most don't even do that.

        No, because ""we"" have decided that it doesn't make enough
difference to ""us"" to get up and do something.  That's something,
for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control
bills at their local government.  Dozens of ""pro-gun"" speakers
show up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.
 
        Why?  Because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters
who's willing to scream afterwards.  And it isn't that most people
give a damn one way of the other, but that they don't.  Nobody
gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.

IF they fired first, without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( I

take it if I do?), then he could be justified in firing on the ATF in

       The Brady Bill passed the House in 1992, but failed to reach a
vote in the Senate.  As such, it never reached Bush.  (Sarah Brady's

       It'll probably pass the House again, and will probably pass the
Senate if they can get it to a vote.  Whether of not they'll be busy
with other things will be the question.  I don't expect gung-ho opposition
on the part of Senate Republicans, since they won't want to over-use their
fillibuster trump card.

A friend recorded CNN news during the gassing and incineration of
the BD's.  I went through it carefully today, and found something
very interesting.  A tank is pulling out of the house, and there
is a fireball, maybe 24"" across that lasts for about 1 second.
Exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts
billowing out of that area of the building.
Now, I'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a
weather balloon or something.  Perhaps someone would check it out

    The lethality in small part, but mostly what I found frightening 
was the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they 
ate breakfast every morning with Jesus Christ. Now I wasn't there in 
Galilee back in the Roman occupation, so I don't know for certain that 
David Koresh was not Jesus Christ, but I strongly suspect that he was 
not (even aside from the fact of never having seen them in a photograph 
together).

    I admit I can't cite a specific, but if there isn't a law against 
purchasing grenade components and assembling them into functioning units 
then perhaps we need one. All second ammendment arguments aside, I'm just 
not sure that I like the idea of private citizens with hand grenades.

I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !
What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especially
to many in wrong hands....

Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affecting
good/responcible gun owners ??


I DO believe in a persons freedom.
What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.

MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE
to give 'a little' to make that society work.

Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.
Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,
so a car is essential in most parts....

Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't 
argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....


EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were
more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!


Is this discussion about

1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans
            or
2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ??

Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.
(Child abuse for instance)

Doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.* hierarcy ??
(Some seems rather mis/unInformed)

No crime here.
Also no substantiation of your claim that Koresh said this.  I for one have
never heard this mentioned before.  Where did you hear it?

Up to which moment?  The one where you decided that anyone who claims to be

What happened to the separation of church and state?

I have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  From what I hear the
*original* warrant (the reason for the Feb. raid) is still sealed.  What are
""unsealed"" seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.

>Then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child

Funny, I haven't seen any of these ""interviews.""
Interesting that when the social services agencies investigated Koresh on
these previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.

> These parents claimed
>psychological and sexual abuse. The childrens' statements supported these
>charges.

Funny, I don't remember hearing anything about childrens' statements,
either.  Where did you say you heard all this?

What *I* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in
the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  This
from the newspaper and national TV news.

Did you also hear that it's the job of the BATF and the FBI to lay siege to
homes where child abuse is suspected?  I thought you did.

>Was it a 'no-knock?' I really haven't heard anything on that. But clearly

""Clearly?""  Please tell us what Koresh was doing that can be construed as
other than ""minding his own business"" before the BATF raided the place.

Or claims to have discovered so...  It would hardly be the first time

> Was it a 'no-knock?' I really haven't heard anything on that. But clearly

It was a ""no-knock"", according to the Associated Press report.
Here's something I found in my collection:

    Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final
    Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):

    WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100
    law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed
    religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members
    were reported killed.  [...]

    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock
    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and
    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in
    Washington.  [...]

    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,
    throwing concussion grenades and screaming ""Come out,"" while three
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no
    response.  Then the shooting began. 

I think ""storming the sect's head-quaters"" and ""throwing concussion
grenades"" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).

Probably not.  But then again, neither are you.

> red-white-and blue American defending his home against Big Brother. That

And just what is ""his background""?  What prior crimes had he been
CONVICTED of?

> Federal Law Enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sorry, BATF are ""Federal TAX Enforcement officials"".  They're not
police, nor do they have police powers.

I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization
which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake 
of the Republican defeat last fall. 

Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of 
support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.

You'd be close to the truth.

Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett, former 'Drug Czar' who heartily
supported Bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - 
who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and
Jack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. 

These are conservatives ? 

Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect's spell check
against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'Bennett' :

1. Banned
2. Bayonet


Needless to say, I found these choices rather amusing.

Are you aware you can make a grenade with gunpower and metal water pipes?
Maybe we should outlaw hardware stores and ammo reloading.

I'm responding at the risk of misreading your response, but I do have to tell 
my fellow conservatives to give it up, attacking Reno/Clinton/ATF/FBI.

They may have botched an operation, but they didn't kill anybody who never shot
at them first.  David Koresh was a frigging lunatic.  His followers had the 
combined I.Q of a Geraldo audience.  The kids probably would have been those
fucked up social rejects who go to Freshman dances in high school, never to be
seen again (except maybe in the band) until prom, when they show up like 
animals boarding the ark.  Then it's bowling till 3 in the morning..... 
(WHY....WHY?? did it happen to me??!!)

Anyway, the point is Janet Reno/Bill Clinton were only following the advice of 
trained, law enforcement officials who were experts in their fields.  I'd 
rather have our leaders do that then micro-manage every crisis that comes 
along.  Then you'd really see trouble no matter what party or ideology the 
President and her (er.. I mean his) Attorney General is.

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is
engaged on a project to ""convert"" the souls of deceased persons of other
religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into
heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so
that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New
Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for
example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the
names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be
made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that
there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and
the story was quite detailed).

Will do! I appreciate the thoughtfullness of the Post to not be an
intermediary for such sales. The ""Right to bear arms"" is one of the most
misapplied rights in our Constitution, and assault weapons go way beyond
what is, or rather should be (imho), a ""natural"" right in America. Just
ask the family of that boy shot back in September - the papers are full of
stories about a child with an assult weapon with a ""angelic face"" (Post)
who committed the murder without ever thinking.

You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?

And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?
Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal

cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their ""OWN CHOICE"".  Problem

Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they ""stockpiled weapons"".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in 
Virginia).The warrant was issued for some ""gun parts"" that are about the size 
of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you 
think?

	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A
fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We
all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have
firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding
upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to
do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with
a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting
the many?  We say ""no,"" while others say ""yes.""

	It is this ""giving a little"" that makes Americans wary...
We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a
Chamberlain ""gave a little"" to a particular fascist/short asshole,
and how such ""appeasement"" worked.  While it might work in some
instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict

	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in
the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,
cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the
arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more
people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict
cars than it does guns.  How one defines ""essential"" often depends
upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we
look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.

>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were
>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!

	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As
Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even
when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did
with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first
acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown
or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.
One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.

I'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but I've never
thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or
competence. I just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that
can't wait a few days. I can think of plenty of bad reasons for not
wanting a waiting period: I want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right
now, I've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and I can't
afford to spend the night here, etc.

I'm not a big fan of guns, but I feel that it is important to guard
American's rights to own them. On the other hand, we license and regulate
many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights.

Maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about

What laws did they circumvent?  Being ""frightening"" isn't a crime.  Some people
are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a
young Black male a crime.

The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no
evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement 
personnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be
acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified
armed intruders.

The charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction
in such matters anyway.  Of course that hasn't stopped them from making other
such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical ""meth labs"".  Of
course they whole ""cult"" thing indicates the level of contempt that they have
for the 1st amendment.

My sig has generated more mail than any of my posts.

Robin Hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts
will have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property
poor districts.  The laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending. 
IMHO, however, it is a disaster waiting to happen.  Taxes will go up in 50% of
the districts and we will lose control of how OUR tax money is spent.  It
penalizes districts that have excelled.

And the election is Saturday. Along with city council, school board and the
unfinished Senate term.  And after I exercise one right, I'm going to exercise
another!

Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American
liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of
Independence.  That document is in fact a justification not just for the right
if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government
gets too oppressive.  It is a very radical document, and I recommend all
Americans... especially those in office... read it once a year.

Sorry Charles...According to the National Safety Council, ACCIDENT FACTS,1991
""In 1990, gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death
for children ages 14 and under.""

 That thinking is so screwed up, I don't even know how to respond to it.
A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt
to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.????????????????
So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she
were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25
through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease
LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease,
chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles,
that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart
Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational
and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES
of death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation
and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.
Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.
 
I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents
group or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't
confuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many
victims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree.
I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of
childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond
to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who
wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths
is trying to make a political issue out of it.

 Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context
for your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually
in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed
concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane
person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined
as ""a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest
number of childhood deaths.""  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I
am inhumane and irrational.

Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting
the facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, ""Firearm murders
of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990""
 
Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state
that ""Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun
accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded"".
 
Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say ""Gunshot
wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas
between 1987 and 1990.""
 
Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state
that ""Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from
1986 to 1988.""
 
Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly
victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't
realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go
into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll
by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious
that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion
and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political
discussion.  I really don't want to do that.

 Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC.
They don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you,
interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health
problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.

WHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE
FIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump
into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1
sentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here???
You're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control
issue out of a discussion that isn't.

Charles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet
Mars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact
with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local
urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition
spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard
gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,
whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and
whether they themselves have ever been shot.
 
Believe me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.

The FBI has claimed from the begining that it wasn't standard use

You can't think of any valid reason to own a gun that can't wait?

Either you have a very limited imagination or a strange definition of
the word ""valid"".

Here are a few reasons you might want a gun *right now*:

You're a Korean greengrocer in LA and a riot has just started in a
nearby neighborhood.

You've received a death threat.

Your SO has just broken your arm and you fear for your life if you
stay with him and he's said he'll kill you if you leave him.

A psychopath is breaking into people's houses in your neighborhood and
robbing and killing people inside.

A violent mugger is operating on the route you have to take to get to
your night job.

There are lots of dangers you might be in that won't wait for the
waiting period for you to purchase a gun.

HB 1776 is for Concealed Carry in Texas.  It provides for licensing
citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction
course (30 hours, if I remember correctly), pay a $140 fee (good for
4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal
character, etc.

While I don't agree with all of the criteria, I feel it's high time
that pro-gun types fight the same way HCI et al. do -- by getting
incremental changes in the law.

      I heard it was delivered in high concentration to counteract the
      wind at 30 mph blowing it away.  What is your source for the
      quoted low concentration?
