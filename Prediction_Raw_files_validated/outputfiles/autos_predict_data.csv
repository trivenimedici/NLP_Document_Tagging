Better still, years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used
""air"". It was called a Rovax. The unit worked very well, the short coming

As I recall from reading posts here a while back, Rovax (Rovacs?) died
because it was larger and noisier than the competing cheap R12 systems
of it day.  Probably a case of bad timing.  I think the system would
have a better chance today now that R12 systems are on death row, but
investors may be hard to come by a second time.

It is actually simple in principle. Porous adsorbents like zeolite and
activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water
or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect.  Upon being heated, the 
gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be
condensed.  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle.  The only problem
is that the COP is very low (0.2 -0.6).

I don't know about where you are, but here in California false
representation
of odometer readings is a criminal felony. If you can substantiate this,
you need to report that dealer to the local authorities. You should consult
with a lawyer to tell you what civil action you can take as well. Keep in
mind that you will have to prove that the dealer was aware of the change in
the dashboard.

Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done
it here in CT.

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.

My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!

I would also be interested in finding out about the '94 Talon,
and I suspect that many other people would be interested too,
so let's get some responses on the net.

The question again:
Does anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon / Mitsubishi
Eclipse / Plymouth Laser?

I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant,
and that in Japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo V6 1994 Galant has been
released.

So anyway, any info on the '94 Talon would be appreciated.

This really bugs me.  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle,
but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
in California.  What a bunch of crap.  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason.

The particulates are nothing but carbon.  They are just an annoyance at worst.
Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions, torque or engine
durability.  It's also cheaper.

I just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a
little Stanza logo ever so discretely placed on the trunk. The Altima is
emblazoned in big silver letters, but the itsy-bitsy Stanza is shunted
to the far left of the trunk lid. You can only see it if you get up
close to the car and know where to look. It is very inconspicuous.

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual
called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima.

Anybody know *why* Nissan did it this way?

Sorry 'bout that - Mine is a '91 model non-turbo 2.0. (with ABS and revised
suspension (whatever revised means)). I'm in Australia, so we always seem to 
get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as 
standard.

My query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after
an oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'm
using (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. gets
noiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing). 

Its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.


Puzzled.

while it's being mentioned, i personally prefer the moonroof/sunroof/t-top/
targa thing as well.  I simply don't like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance,
nor the S**** color matching alot of companies do.  If i chose a convertible,
it'd be:

a) Mazda RX7 II.  I just like the way they look.  It'd have to be in black,
with color matched black top(they look good!)

b) VW cabriolet.  They do a suberb job of matching colors too.  Also, last year
for them!  {***COLLECTOR'S ITEM****}

c) mustang GT droptop...they look ok too.

i know this doesn't help, but i thought i'd do it anyway...:-)

good luck to your wife.(and you :-)

not sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment.  Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but
if you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny.  So you actually ARE paying more, just
that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped ""standard"".  (this
applies to MOST cars, but not to the luxoyachts..eg caddilac, licolns, etc..)

The Manta came out in the 1974 model year and was a 4 seat coupe.

In 1972, they lowered the engine compression so that it would run on
regular gas (not to mention the addition of emission controls).  The '72 
also added pop-out rear quarter windows...

Alot of parts are available for the GT from C & R Small Cars in CT and
used from Bill Daley's Opel Parts in MA....

Believe Bugatti's coming(has) out  one.  Something like 4 turbos
and mucho macho HP.  One cool price too, as i heard.  At any rate,
the point is, i'm pretty sure there is, indeed, one in production...

You are sure that what you call a 200SX we call a 240?  Just curious..
We also have a nissan predacessor (sp) to the 240 called a 200, which
came in turbo and nonturbo.  But i don't think we've ever had a 240

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy.

 Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel
Vehicles
 To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters
 Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806

   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy
Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on
Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a ""driving force
behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative
fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.""
   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for
federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the
next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for
in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner
Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to
advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.
   ""I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make
this happen,"" O'Leary said.  ""As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has
helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet
to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural
gas vehicles in speeches across the country.""
   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending
a plan and schedule of implementation.
   ""The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead
by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a
practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,""
O'Leary said.  ""Increased use of domestically-produced alternative
fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe
that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy
economy are complimentary goals.""
   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to
coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with
funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA
to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make
fleet conversions practical.
   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working
with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle
purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make
alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely
available.

I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata.  I
know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that
have them swear by them.  They also haven't had the problems with
them that Consumer Reports claims.  I haven't driven one yet.  I
have driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also
trashed) and was very impressed with it.  The local Hyundai
dealership (""no-haggle"" policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power
moonroof for $13163.  They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for
$13997.  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and
4-spd automatic.  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test
driving both the 4-cyl and the V6.  The Sonata is also offering a
$1500 rebate.  Hmmm, that's another question.  Is the following
scenario the appropriate manner to handle ""negotiation""?

1.  make offer
2.  subtract rebate from offer
3.  talk trade
4.  subtract trade from offer to get final price

wrong and wrong.  mitsubishi owns the patent, which has since expired
which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance
shafts into their big 4's.. the notable exception is nissan.. and only
for the us market suckers.  i guess we need to write to C&D and start
telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm.  then
you'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine A has peak
vibrations 3 dB less than engine B, therefore engine A is better than

Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch.

>>>I've read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
>>>guns by police depts (I'm not sure where).
More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments.
The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can
  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called
  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost
  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an
  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure.
Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!

Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
commission. That's another story for another day.

First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division
is ""Infiniti"" not ""Infinity.""  I would also like to clear up the question
of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since a
person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models
had V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each
manufacturer used V8 engines.

Lexus:
  LS400- V8
  GS300- V6
  ES300- V6
  SC400- V8
  SC300- V6

Infiniti:
  Q45- V8
  J30- V6
  G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here)

gee.... is it 1999 already?

Yes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be different
on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown. The suspension will most
likely be changed, as well as the drive drain. From what has been printed on
it, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have
the modular V8 and others the current small block... just have to wait and see
Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good, a return to tradition.
C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a '65 or '66 fastback.

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as 
heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then, in fact.
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here 
about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear 
about something like that, period.

Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are

since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight

Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.
   There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say ""Go to authorized mazda dealer."". It is really good idea. Don't you think so? 
  I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as ""authorized mazda dealer"" can give ?

who cares about typos of these meaningless, synthetic names?  if the
cars were named after a person, e.g. honda, i'd be more respectful.

wrong!  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a
V6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline
6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.

        Check out the shocks where they mount, at both ends. if you have
    the type that have a loop?,from lack of a better term, and a bolt like
   piece sticking through, there should be a rubber bushing between the loop
   and the bolt. Is it there ? is it crushed and allowing metal to metal

I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not
the actual car, but a prototype?

I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too
Japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...

Glad I didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  Maybe they'll work on
the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking
'95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,
e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too).

I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any
relevant newsgroups in my area.

For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops
measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  I'm
especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior
experiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR
in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. 
What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk
of being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there's no way to
fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are.

Thanks a lot,

I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det
ector available. The point here is trust and reliability. I've been able to ""tr
ust"" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine sa
ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo
re than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many
 falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t
o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.

That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa
ys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br
ain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information
 at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng
th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each
bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo
u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i
t works okay.

Although, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of
one radar souce.

I agree with Gaia. Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car
so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind.

In my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough. In my case, that's be
cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors,
 etc.) I could do myself. I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such.

Plus I think the extra 3 years of 24-hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so

I hadn't heard of the Valentine-1 before. Car&Driver and other auto
magazines
recommend BEL detectors.  I was considering their latest - the 966STi -
which picks up Super Wideband Ka and Laser as well.  It also avoids 
radar detector detectors (although I really don't care about this since I
doubt I'll be driving in Virginia anytime soon - or have any other states
also made detectors iilegal?)

How does the Valentine-1 compare with the BEL products?

I want to thank all the people that responded to my post

I decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month.
I replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil.  So far
no problems have surfaced.

I received many suggestions and encouragement on this

My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops).  My current car is a convertible.
IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top,
sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no
substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating
down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and
jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the
whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.
So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call
it a convertible.

And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar in a rollover situation.  Of course, I'd rather not test it
in MY car.  I, too, am in my early 40s.

A convertible--accept no substitute.

And here's my two cents:

The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but
you're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room
of a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car
ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates
like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.

The targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles.

Well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have.  My previous
car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. 
The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory
service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was
supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking
nut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no
one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking
lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I
found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid
of the locking nuts. :-(

My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the
dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to
be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the
package and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems
with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did
have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire
balancing.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason
they are considered ""cleaner"" is because they are better at the emissions we
actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or
limits have been defined.  

Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates
are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence
is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may
have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.

And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in
rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is
awful and it can even burn the eyes.  

Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.

I consider the basic set to be:

	- oil pressure

others that are nice to have:

& 
& just out of curiosity, how is this ""dog clutch"" any different from a synchro
& transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""
& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very
corse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the
gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back
and forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the
clutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If 
you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into
the next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral
between gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the
shifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  ""speed shifting""
(which is what I have always heard ""clutchless shifting"" called) works
pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the
clutch-especially for the lower gears.

I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the
engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of
syncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions
that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse
and sometimes first).

I have tested both vehicles (identically
equipped), both for week-long periods.
Curiously (and consider these are test
vehicles), I found the Mercury higher
in build quality than the Nissan.

Either choice is good, but beware that
I did not experience reasonable mileage
with the V6.  Average city driving was
<15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway.

Both were optioned to the hilt (the Nissan
had leather!).  The Villager was in the
$24K range and the Nissan was over $26K.

Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys

You're actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil?

C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!

That's absolutely ridiculous!

Besides, how hard is it to get under the car to 
change the oil?

I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and
changed the oil on, my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but
once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it
gets easier.

I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.

I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use  
S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle
and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough 
to test for wear, but some people I know have.   
 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50
he has went 5 years without an overhaul.

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers
had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of 30K miles not 200K.

In my opinion it works.

Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new
to our species...

What about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The
religious persecutions of the middle-ages? 

What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
the world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans?
The Jews persecuted by Christians?

There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not
know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there
were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are
probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
thousand years ago!

There is nothing new about violence.

No comparison. The BEL is just a hooped up wideband Escort like detector.
No directional indicators, no Bogey counter, no radar signature analysis, no

i say extended warranties are a ripoff, high-profit item for dealers.
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
5/60k, 6/75k, 6/100k.  you get 3yr/36k *free*.  so what you are buying is
2/24k, 3/39k, 3/64k.  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs. coverage.
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warranty...why?  design/manufacturing defects that the company owns up
to, keeping customer happy, etc.

Oh, that's not so bad. Every time I try to change the oil, I forget to
shut off the engine first. The hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds
me, then the engine starts to overheat, and while I'm screaming in agony
and trying to crawl out from under the car, I grab the red hot exhaust
pipe and get third degree burns on my hands. My screams intensify as I
finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of
the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super
heated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head
explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron.

This happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic
$25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new
car. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles.

The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked
quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as
some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had
the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want
except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are
considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we
both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and
performance were both significant.

Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.

Mazda 626
 + very comfortable and roomy
 + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is
   hard to find
 + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:
   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat
 - more expensive than many other cars listed below

Honda Civic
 + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
 + comfortable front seat
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)

Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla
 - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 + can get ABS without lots of other extras

Saturn
 + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so
 - motorized attack belts

Dodge Spirit
   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok
 - rear seat does not fold down

Chevy Corsica
 + comes with ABS standard
 - lower ""would you buy that car again"" and safety ratings in
   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)
 - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +
   for some)

The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the
626, and in our minds, not significantly better.

We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the ""big 3"",
due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,
(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate
of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the
seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts
and no air bag.

We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and
cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14,
I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I will
probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mind
is whether or not I will have to do a ""factory order"" or ""preference
order"" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will
run the price up a lot if I do so.

this is an interesting point.  some people are not really buying the coverage,

Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)
Distribution: usa
Lines: 30

After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone
with ""Pontiac Systems"" or ""Pontaic Customer Service"" or whatever, and
inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and
Trans Am.  BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me
nowhere.  After being routed to a ""Firebird Specialist"", I was able
to confirm that this is in fact the case.

At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.
She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some
shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they
simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she
was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,
feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.

Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
to the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is
a production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was
not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore
having to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive
that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.

Can anyone else shed some light on this?

""IF"" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew

undo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.

As well as putting bad things in the gas...

While I would never vandalize someone's car, IF I were to, it would probably
be the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks

A mileage chart should be available in the book.  It usually goes by
the class of car you own and year.  Usually you will end up adding a few
hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it...  Consumer
Reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area.
A friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service.  I
believe it cost about $10.00.

Try another dealer.  Sometimes the sophistication of equipment etc is
better at one dealer than another.  You may also find another dealer
willing to help you with the problem.

Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their
clutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of
high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in
his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics!
Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-)
Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the
time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts
of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. 

>And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

Yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve ""fun."" :-)

I personally would _love_ to have a '66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe,
with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side
my '66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390
with three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the
morning! :-). There's no comparison between a REAL American
Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO.

Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was 
thinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. 

On inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried
in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate
from the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I
forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This,
unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid) under that state's law.

Gee, and I thought Federal Law overrode state law...

For a reasonable sum, you can get a BMW with traction control:
a torque-sensing (limited slip) rear differential.  Since no
FWD car, including the Saab, has this kind of front differential,
since it would exacerbate torque steer, a BMW with traction control
should have the theoretical advantage on snow.  Of course weight
distribution and skinny tires could affect this...

If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a
speedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation.
 
My 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum:  Engine-temp and
Oil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge. 

My 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter 
and oil-temp gauges. 
 
If I had a turbo car, I'd want a vacuum manifold/boost
gauge.  An oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring
gauge to look at.  If my car was air cooled, then I
would substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp
gauge.
 
A few years ago, I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe
that Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb.
The gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was:
 
----------------------------------
 
speedometer

""traction control"" as far as the optional feature that one buys with
cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential.

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's
are torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to
viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing.
for that matter, so are ""traction control"" systems that use ABS
sensors and pulse braking.

then there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not
familiar with the workings.

Save youself the cash.  Take it from a BMW mechanic.  Idiot lights are for just that.  Buy yourself a ballpoint pen and write it down yourself.  Change your oil every 3000 mi. and you will be just fine.

	Follow the regular service intervals in you r book also.

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed
fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the
previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has
to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,
and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that
the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo 
was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must 
be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. 

Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search
(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor
Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your
rights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-)

I've been in two _major_ auto accidents, both were multiple car.  The worst
was a head-on three car collision (T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign).  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it
coming both times). 

>Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can

If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the
car.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little
extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone. 

One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some
training.  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving
ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two
driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very
worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). 

Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at
that.

Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five

it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

Yep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge

2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. Try  
flashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you

Rich,
	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq

	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may
	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver
	and or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette
	Black Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.
	Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a
	few hours in reading the ""Corvette Buyer's Guide"" and purchase Noland
	Adams' tape ""How to Buy a Corvette.""  The tape shows you how to check
	for damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the
	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The
	list is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where
	there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage
	vettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above
	are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised,
of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.  Also, most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my two
feet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_
operate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it 
can't be done).  Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money.

You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next
Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable
than the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  

The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,
just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is
barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that
can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line
with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;
it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come
with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're
getting better and making the move in the right direction.

They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only
in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't
press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.
Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.

I do not put much stock in the mag rags' ""inside"" information, or even
Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it's entirety.  ""Inside"" information had the
Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look
for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself
if you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new
car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those
modular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and
competition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,
who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.
Highly.

The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts
way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage
is more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that.

I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,
intelligent, critical spews like, ""The Mustang bites, man!""  Some of
you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the
differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.
The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its
cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still
reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to
the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while
the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.
Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be
no clear winner.

Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?

flat = 180 deg V = horizonatlly opposed

Usually, it also equals ""boxer,"" however, I think the term is
traditionally reserved for 8's and 12's (and firing order matters).
This was talked about here in r.a many months back; I can't remember
the consensus.

Examples:

Ferrari's 512TR is a flat 12 boxer.
Porsche's 911 is a flat 6.
Subaru's Impreza is a flat 4.

- Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If
you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the
California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
the tire.

- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.

- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.

- invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded,
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.

- Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
new state, to catch all the speeders who have ""escaped"" the previous state.

- Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
65mph rural interstate

Subject: Weird problem with GM 4-banger transmission
Organization: SPC Community Access System
Lines: 34

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before
I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check ""net.wisdom"" on the
subject. :)

It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)
2.0l EFI 4-banger
auto
35k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at
highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting ""stuck"" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for
a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting
for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to ""reset"" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when
put in drive.  

My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up
converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least
likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum
hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want. :)

I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free
beer. <grin>

Actually the company, and the product was ROVAC - which stood for
ROTary Air Conditioning..it used a rotary compressor with what
was effectively an air/air heat exchanger, and worked pretty well.
The negatives were mostly that it was about 5-10% less efficient than
using freon, and noise problems from the high velocity/pressure air,
all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt.  It
is still a legal entity in Florida, but I believe completely ""dead""..
and there's a heck of an opurtunity to buy up it's patents and restart
the operation...

The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with
the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:

1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged.
2. All use an ""aftercooler"", which cools the air which was heated
   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).
3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air
   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is
   low.

No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from
the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.

Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output 
and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket
turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,
and these are approved by the CARB.

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.

Only if you want to stop. Seriously though, every 2 years you should
have this done. Brake fluid absorbs water over time, the water becomes
steam when the fluid gets hot, and steam compresses. You'll also have
better luck with the longevity of master cylinder, calipers and brake

i am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration
and not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you
care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this
configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary
forces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me
that says so.

the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted
longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal
placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.

i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours
are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,
though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a
boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
recent hondas can approach.

Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.
Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter
is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
the converter gets into its operating range).

The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its
much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay 
attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people
to the morgue than drunk driving. The problem is that we don't revoke peoples

i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180

true boxers.  don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that

I'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance

anyone understand what the ""Limited Tort Option"" means.  Will it lower

to have it?  What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  Is
it a good deal or should I ignore it?  I'm not the type to sue anyone

Eliot is right about 2.2 liter engine in the second (and last) generation
MR2's. But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR2. If it's a
first generation car (like my '85), it has 1.6 liter engine (or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger, if it's '87 -'89).
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard.
I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes, my simply
makes noise. Not all that annoying, mind you. But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear :-)

The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my ""car circle"" is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior.
After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in 
a volume car.  

The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of
the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford
is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. 

Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new
Camaro/Firebird, IMO.  

I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will 
achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation
to ""just get them out the door"" for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off.

Hi all,
I have available to me a set of Metric wheels (came off a Mustang or T-Bird)
which are wearing nearly-bald Michelin TRX 220-55R390 tires.  The only place
I have found these tires is the Tire Rack mailorder place for $121 a pop.
Is there a cheaper source, or another manufacturer of this size tire?  Thanks
for any info...please E-Mail responses and I will post a summary if there is
any interest.

This must vary from state to state, because our old company Kemper wanted
to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket.
Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit.  Well i called Geico, and they
insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying
Kemper.

Generally i hate the whole insurance game. I realize that it is necessary
but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense.

One good thing about Geico is that everything can be handled over
the phone.

This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision
(less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor
is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand
pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why
everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last
generation Suburban HIC numbers). 

As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that
seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt 
will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be

saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
wearing no seat belt?

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.

less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how

Organization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA

NNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net
Summary: Why the repeated leaks?
Keywords: clutch master cyl problems

I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions.
The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout
a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        
leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid
back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and
got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem
licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months
later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure
there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I
didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch
hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I
would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the
problem.

I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the
pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in
order to actuate the clutch.

My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,
the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the
cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.

What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix
short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?

Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain
why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the
passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which
the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What
can you suggest here?

Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...

i think those with 1.6 MR2's would describe the engine as sweet if a

it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is ""only"" 2 liters.. the engineers

the MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also ""only"" 2 liters.. as usual, the

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased
the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing
list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and

Well, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone
hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may
not associate the sound with a small ""jap car"" style car (like the Probe is).

The mudflaps help a lot.

>>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)

I have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I
(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty
high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with
torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the
highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I 
probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been
around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the
""control"" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out
to be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in 
""we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts"" :-)


>>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  I've gotten them to fix the
worst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.

>>Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

On my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears,
and had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when
I tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe
look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow
tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles
very very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough
surface.

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension ""interesting"".
The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm
ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and
feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.

>>If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find

Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, ""consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf"".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not
have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).

>>Also, there's a lot of glass

A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That ""lots of glass"" you

see in all the write-ups.  Most ""sports/sporty"" cars don't have that
good visibility.

The complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on

I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.

I was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still

Yes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up

for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.
Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  It is
a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you 
shouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  In my case, they fixed it on
my extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the
work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  Having
removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate
was fair.

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph

'63 to '82 vettes had the same basic chassis. 1980 add aluminum (weaker)

  Late 70's was a bad year for GM reliability.  Catastrophic converter was

Cheapest corvette '78 to '79 low end about 4k tops out about $12k except 
for those morooons that think there '78 indy / 25th aniversity vette is

Best buy: convertables 69 - 74.  I got my 69 for 5K - needs body work but 
I'm willing.  

Parts for all are readily avail at swap meets and mail order etc.

V-8 reliability / looks / independant suspension / 4 wheel disk and all

My origional inquires to my insurance agent: I can drive my '69 convertable

Get an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look 
for origional equipe.  Depending on what mods have been done the car could 
be worth only 10K.  Problems like wrong engine / trans.  Wrong paint type (
vetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your 
looking for a car to drive right?

This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual 
/ no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.

Get it appraised!!!  For insurance purposes also.

	Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925  
to 1935.  They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  
the crimp on luxury cars.  It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
power.  ""They don't make them like they used to.""  
	There were others though.  Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  
sized to their legendary Twin-Six, their mainstay for the next twenty years.   
Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure.
	Most luxury and semi-luxury cars of this era at least experimented with  
V16 if they did not actually produce them.  There was actually a ""cylinder war""

Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim
=============================================

Background:

    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving
a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been
interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing
the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a
remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.
As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still
have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.

    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was
already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as
having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.
However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I
can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the
car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum
plugs and valve adjustment.

    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.
The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,
although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small
scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the
highway.

    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit
concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To
my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems
just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)
Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of
the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and
in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit
more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.

    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up
for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the
ride later in this review.


Engine:
    
    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very
interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was not
disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is
good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although
I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly
-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good
since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.
(More on this later.)

    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be
unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit
higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can
literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve
more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and
you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.
The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!

    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the
tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,
you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than
adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves
are used.


Transmission:

    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they
marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter
into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and
remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the
car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.

    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a
Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the
one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit
larger and more forgiving.

    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter
felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect
it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's
much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's
a clumsy shifter.

    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress
friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for
the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this
pretty amazing in a car like this.

    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest
shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my
Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.
Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line
because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.

    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more
reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works
smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter
upgrade would help at all.

    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to
match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took
several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems
were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad
shifts in higher gears.)

    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter
refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to 
get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
of months.

    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500
rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the
engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can
definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,
as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHO
sound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"".
Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.


Exterior:

    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this
SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are
virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes
don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did
differently to the SHO bodies.

    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching
color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the
SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at
stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.
:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely
monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with
""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have
colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.

    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel
almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and
distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)


Interior:

    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the
car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are
covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in
a black/grey/metallic scheme.  

    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo
and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a
large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest
that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin
holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding
cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small
glove compartment.

    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted
to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a
sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and
thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the
interior was upgraded!

    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so
much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)

    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From
what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.
Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has
cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the
way.

    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal
hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that
you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to
it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.


Ride:

    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than
any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter
and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with
less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a
noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels
wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I
listened for that before I bought the car.

    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from
Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone
from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively
quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what
exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window
that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.

    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the
suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way
too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would
advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with
the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason
to complain.  Let me explain...

    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the
wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer
making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I
avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.

    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.

    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.
My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the
wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when
driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so
useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road
to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better
than the steering on my Celica ST.

    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?


Miscellaneous notes:

    GRIPES:

    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles
        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.

    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as
	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.
	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)

    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension
	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.

    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the
	side bolsters would close more tightly.  

    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I
	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500
	for four.

    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it
	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't
	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!
	Pretty ridiculous, though.

    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,
	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque
	down low.

    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It
	took me a couple of days before I could really shift
	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)

    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that
	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 
	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make
	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever""
	for tips in this department.  :-)

    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once
	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch
	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off
	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 
	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 
	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of 
	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 
	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)

    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same
    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the
	other windows work smoothly.


    LIKES:

    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The
    	cupholders are great.

    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but
	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by
	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And
	you can never lock yourself out of the car.

    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't
	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 
	ahead of schedule.  :-)

    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to
	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I
	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines
	and ended up with this.  

    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have
	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 
	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this
	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you
	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)

    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums
	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice
	the horsepower.  



Other Odds and Ends:

    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.
Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I
haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still
appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always
quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some
of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)

    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as
well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be 
posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  

    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!
I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but 
maybe someone out there does.

I have the same problem with my '90 probe.  The water is definitely not comming
up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare.  I have to remove the
rubber stopper to drain the water.  Seems like a common problem with probe.

best way to reduce risk when operating a vehicle is being able to avoid
hazards and, for that reason my preferred vehicle is a motorcycle.  When I do
use a four wheeler my primary reasons are: it will keep me dry, it will keep
me warm, or it will carry more cargo.  If the four wheeler has as much
collision protection as the average motorcycle, then it has enough form me.

How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and

Mustang. (We all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway)

-> Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new
-> Camaro/Firebird, IMO.

I must agree. I don't think I've seen anything as impressive looking as
the new Firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 Formula 400
Firebird (for a paltry $2000, without even telling me. The bastard.)

Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'm
not talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began
production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)

I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all
models, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price range
should I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college right
now, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a ride to
school, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in
the spring/fall. I think that the Bronco (with the removable fiberglass)
would be a better (read ""bigger"") choice than a CJ-5 or CJ-7.

Even better: anybody in the Maryland/Virginia area interested in selling
one?

Yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's
and sound. I know the celicas with em were pretty noisey, and
the MR2s were no exception. Now, about large displacement 4s
with bad noise.. I have a 90 Grand Am H.O. quad 4, and it
sounds really good, almost like a larger 6.. Now, Toyota
is coming out with an all-new Celica next year and the Mr2...

Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its
too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the
LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why
spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take 
an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.)

Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17"" aluminum rims and
Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read: 
plush police package) with 300 horsepower.

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get 
their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1.

On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth
the paper it's printed on.  Once you sign, you are going to have one hell of a

Reply-To: pv9955@albnyvms.bitnet

I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it.
I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v.
I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same
name:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard
sunroof. 
Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !!
So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the
two models of the Jetta GLI ?
More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are
no badges that said ""16v"" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version.
Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid
reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ?
(Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)

Please EMail any responses.  Thank you.

I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a 
question on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at 
2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the
norm?  I'm an auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are
the proper ranges?  Somehow the rpm figures seem high.  A friend of mine
just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta (2.8l V6.)
Also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z?
(Not that I would try it but it would be an interesting factoid. :)

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a ""seriously handsome car with broad shoulders,"" I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.

I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according
to owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good,
body is OK, he wants $3000.
i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one, and she wants auto.
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!)
The A/C seems to have a leak. 
The sunroof is sticky, but operational.
Odometer does not work, as mentioned before.
Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.
Wipers are slow.
That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, 
rotors and calipers, exhaust.
The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange
stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how
often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,
although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking 
it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it.
So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust.
I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers

Nntp-Posting-Host: ssc.sas.upenn.edu

My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached
the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be
able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,
please e-mail or post!

1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,
   there is usually a loud ""thunk"" from the rear of
   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.
   What could cause this?  Is the differential going
   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,
   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,
   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the
   trunk!)  

2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from
   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves
   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the
   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?

3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is
   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to
   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel
   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes
   might help -- could anything else cause this?

4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more
   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.
   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put
   through all the gears and then back to park, as per
   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.

5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have
   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps
   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are
   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?

I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners
out there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,
these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted
into taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a
junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be
junked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of
the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and
Impalas (& Broughams).

Japan is _much_ more open than Korea.

Yes.  A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price
when it is exported to Japan.

However, a Dodge vehicle (the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned)
suffers a factor of _4_ increase in price when it is exported to Korea.
A Ford Taurus suffers the same problem.  A Honda Accord costs--I am
not making this up--$48,000 in Korea.

Just how many people would want to buy a Honda Accord for $48,000?

Solution:  All ships carrying Korean-made vehicles should be returned
           to Seoul.  Pronto.  Until as such time as Korea decides
           that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade
           with the USA and Japan.

I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didn't fit plus it is the
highest cost of all the ones you mentioned. I have good friends who have all
three of the trucks you talked about, the ones with kids all went to the
ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk
you need. The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan. Every one has
been happy with what they bought. Although no one is into serious four wheel
off road driving.

Now, now, before we get too carried away here....

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the
car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.

	Just a quick, simple question really...

	How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 Nissan
Maxima. I've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual
to me. I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear
wheels. Also, how powerful is the emergency brake usually? Enough to lock
wheels at 30mph? Hmmmm... I just have to wonder about some of the things I
hear...

	Hahahahahaha.  *gasp*  *pant*  Hm, I'm not sure whether the above
was just a silly remark or a serious remark.  But in case there are
some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data
file on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer
a luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do
have at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is
that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and
buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is
no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration
wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide
his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.

	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only
car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and
I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as
Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still
quite expensive.

	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics
and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed.

anyone else experiencing a similar problem?

This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch
is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there
is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the
clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated
that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch
surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.

I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase.
I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car.
I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car.
But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or
on the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives in
Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.  
Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?

Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and
register a used car ?  (I've never done this before.)

Thank you,

Well, the 1.6 IS music to my ears. I often turn my stereo off and just run
it towards red line on nice twisty roads. But Toyota engines at idle have
a strange ""bells and whisstles at the bottom of a matal can"" sound. I can't

Just like all the older Benzes have a very characteristic clattering sound

Geico supports (reads gives to police) Laser Radars.  They have been known 
to be very picky.  No sports cars. No radar detectors (although Maryland 
insurance board over rules this consistantly). No turbos.

Basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want 
you.  They once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of 
my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance. 
 ""We must insure all the cars"".  I think this rep didn't know what she was 
talking about.

Geico is cheap.  But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped.  I 
think in most areas two tickets will do it.

Geico will never see a dime from me If I can help it.

State Farm.  Slighty higher than most but very good response.  Not as picky 
as Geico.

GM has always screwed the rest of the divisions in favor of the
Corvette. The current platform is no exception. The ""detuned"" Camaro and
Firebird is a load of crap to keep people from realizing that they can
buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about $10,000.

I like the idea of an Impala SS, but if they really wanted to impress

Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can
say is ""it depends"".  They're both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I
are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year.
The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream.
Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in
customer satisfaction.  They're both very attractive, and hideously
expensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The
300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful
on slippery surfaces.

The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note

junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.

Summary: Need pre-purchase help

My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially
restored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual
mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and
compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body
and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,
front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.
The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by
a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.
Questions:

Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?

The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way
of braking action?

It seemed to be ""doggy"" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect
it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?

The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather
was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever
shrunk?

Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?

Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?

Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned
an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with
these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be

To avoid paperwork associated with re-certification as a brand new car,
etc. So for ad purposes it's a brand new nameplate, for paperwork it's
still a Stanza.

Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't
sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.
So you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't
sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.

At least, that's how I understand it.

I would guess the high price of gas in Europe (compared to the US) has
always favoured 4-cylinder manuals.

small engines with autos are a real bore...

But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in
the US?

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torque-rich
V8's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress, and that this has just lived on.

And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using
Geico.  Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want
to make radar detectors illegal.  They also ask if you have a detector
(probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you).

I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that

Subject: REVIEW: Audi S4 quattro
Organization: skulls 'r us
Lines: 175
Distribution: world
Reply-To: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)
NNTP-Posting-Host: lanmola.engr.washington.edu

It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit
to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he
makes a not too sucessful living selling them.

Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:


1) Servotronic steering:

[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the
name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and
used in Audis and BMWs.]

I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past
couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of
the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to
report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I
suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been
loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that
I have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much
happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no
longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is
ruined.

The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I
suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that
some makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and
there is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for
improvement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the
Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in
""feel"" and engineer it out completely.


2) Engine

Wheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did
not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be
putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific
punch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it
encourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so
supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2
liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a
fashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm
redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which
translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A
chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.
The technical achievement is breadthtaking.

Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In
fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts
are almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the ""overboost"" feature
than to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features
up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like
lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the
right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a
few moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,
maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb
ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to
develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite
a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado
VR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding
in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one
is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the
turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very
refined but bland sounding 5 banger..

Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as
serene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite
up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that
in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of
harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,
lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark
that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.
The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under
full boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more
musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,
with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can
match its grunt.

The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking
off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra
inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat
delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. 
Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price
to pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should
offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in
extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The
characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,
in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the
slush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...


3) Chassis

I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively
modest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..
which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke
wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge
whatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth
watering macho, yet subdued look. 

On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body
style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as
road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I
digress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved
out of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough
roads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers
do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will
never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or
pony cars.

The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to
be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was
able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I
think a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,
talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a
banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I
went around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the
skin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and
completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the
limits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were
thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely
uninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of
story.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those
reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical
efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.

The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty
well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too
surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi
100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more
wooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the
luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by
additional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to
brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days
seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on
anti-lock capability.


4) Comfort

For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also
excellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel
inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected
gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this
and that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed
because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the
car has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how
much the turbo dominates its performance.  

Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as
well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.

Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't
consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough
to sway a potential buyer.


5) Conclusion

Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price
of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to
offer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if
it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker
offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is
worth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also 
top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant 
automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series
Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my
thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being
all out exciting and intoxicating.

My suggestion look at your current insurance card, there will be a name 
accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by.
Call information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the 
Houston area, call the insurance company.

Your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want,
do you want to carry comp and collision (probably not on an 82),
what your driving record is.  You mentioned none of these things in your
posting so how can anyone give you accurate information.

Like I said, pick up the phone and make a few calls, it won't kill you.

There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
will come back on after 2-3 weeks. The tool is in fact illegal (in Europe 
atleast). It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
used BMW and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! Other than that, I know 
of no other tool.... anyone else? 

About changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer Audis, they 
only require it after every 12,000 miles (I am talking about an oil change)
Just a query: do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully? Like no sudden 
acceleration etc? If yeah, then the 15,000 M oil change seems quite reasonable.
But if you drive kinda fast... I'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy

(a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean
all the others will come on every 3k too)

For the information of those not ""lucky"" enough to live in the city of
Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks,
it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance
unique (I think) to the city of Austin.

Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here.
Recovered freon is not required to be ""purchased"" from the car it is
withdrawn from.  As a matter of practice, some shops here are charging 
a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it 
is reintroduced to the system.

Just another quality service from an _Enviornmentally Conscious_ city.

In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 T-Bird SC. 
They all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake 
problem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
after about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
the T-Bird I'll never buy a Ford again.

Here in Australia most cars are manual (privately owned anyway).  Why?
Not sure, I think it has something to do with the fact that our car industry
in the past was more closely aligned with Europe than the US in the past.
Now it's aligned with Asia.

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather -
it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.

This is kind of interesting.  I always assumed that the 240SX was named

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever
done. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue
for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:
1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is
some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)

2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver
was drunk)

3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal
to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever
happening).

You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can
still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited
tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who
treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In
exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save
$150/year.

Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse
people so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.
I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance
companies would be pushing harder for repeal.

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm
Bricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian.  He was the first one to import
Subarus, and later was responsible for importing Yugos, I believe. 
Anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports
car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  The
Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.
 If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to
design ""experimental"" safety cars, you will recognize the general
appearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  Anyone recall other
safety features?  The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right.

Personally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the
old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  The choice of
colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly
visible, I suppose.  

The Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no
motor at all.

The clutch on my '92 Honda Civic EX-V (EX in the U.S.) does this too.
It's annoying.  Now that I think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is
high.  The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is 
a ""self-adjusting hydraulic design"".  Yeah, right.

A dealer will make money off you in three ways, if you let him:

	1)  New car markup over his cost (remember his hold-back),
	2)  Arranging financing through the dealership, and
	3)  Screwing you on the trade.

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at 
""dealer's cost"" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a 
kickback from the bank.

Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average 
retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself, 
try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.

Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not
actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on
real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode
and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does
is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes
sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different
directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its
reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.

I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case
there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I
passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then
the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With
other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.
But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there
was another trap.  And there was!

On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from
a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator
changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where
the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the 
place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector
that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the
car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would
have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar
trap when there was none.

I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features
to be useful and not gimmicks.

Subject: HELP with 89 Mitsubishi Galant GS Transmission
Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA
Lines: 43
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: phakt.usc.edu

Hi,
I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.
Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a ""popping"" or ""hitting"" sound.
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say 
this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?
And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse:
   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.
   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is
      fully depressed.
   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.
   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if
      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)
   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.
   6- The shifter acted normally after that.

When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the 
clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last
week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the
problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car.  
In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,
and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily
solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck. 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting 
from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi.  
All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to
bore you with the long post.

Thanks,
Rabih.

Turbo boost is necessary if a turboed car.

It would also be nice to have a gauge that would cycle across the different

I had a similar experience.  We had a written quote which had been mailed
to us from the salesman at one of these ""no-haggle"" Toyota dealers for
a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we
went in to take them up on their offer, they ""discovered"" that certain
extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote.
It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we
had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.

Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they
don't have to deal.  We walked, went out and bought a new LH car
(Eagle Vision TSI) and I don't regret it one bit!

Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...
I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were
cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra ""junk"" put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims
you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it
was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested
scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than ""cats"".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like
to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise.

BTW, (I named my subject ""Dirty Diesels"" because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
read it...)

That would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from '69 to '73.  It originally
had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based
on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear
and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was
limited as a performer.

There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other
models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that
were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer
1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,
and a ""sport coupe"", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there
were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900
engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also
available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,
but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.

In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last
year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations
and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing
to build the GTs.

The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the
Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with
Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and
wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century
low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.

From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by
the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them
Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.

Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the
70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.

Parts are still available from a number of sources.

(I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could
collect in 20 years).

If a manual transmission is a ""must have"", then the M-B 300TE is not in
the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North
America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the
distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.

The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.
I have an '87 300E, with a ""mere"" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always
nice, but I can't complain.

I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:

1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.
2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously ""hook"" into
   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful
   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it
   does not have this problem.)
3) Huge interior and cargo space.
4) The most ""rubbery"" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It
   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.
   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.
   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed
   the car for an automatic.
5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics.)

You should also check out the new BMW 525 ""touring"".  This is a wagon version
of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it 
yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase
just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.

>i know that the ""blue book"" value for the car is $2825.

I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for
retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can 
get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage
and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself.
Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country
that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for
California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is
to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or
looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It 
might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for
6 months for the best price).

>an acquaintence
>has offered to give me blue book value for the car.

I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure
that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's
a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating
than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying
in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go
elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot
or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach
than selling to a private party.

 Stay away from GEICO.

 A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free
 laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit
 enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket
 your premium will increase dramatically based on how much ""over the
 limit"" you were.  If I remember correctly, at ""more than 20 over"",
 you'll get something like a 65% increase. 

 If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped
 immediately. 

 One accident claim and you will be dropped.
 After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made
 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped 
 immediately.  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with
 no complaints.

 I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints.

    I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since
I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since. 
The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and
fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater
than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed.
(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance)
Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that
by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather
complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or
using a numerical method.

anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:

            Cd = d/(q*2R)

       where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius
of the clyinder.
   To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's
width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that
the car would need to overcome.

The new Cruisers DO NOT have independent suspension in the front.  They
still
run a straight axle, but with coils.  The 4Runner is the one with
independent
front.  The Cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system.

The 91-up Cruiser does have full time 4WD, but the center diff locks in
low range.  My brother has a 91 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which
has done all the 4+ trails in Moab without a tow.  The 93 and later is even
better with the bigger engine and locking diffs.

The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 4.0L straight 6 which only has about 150hp

If you take them on rough trails, you'll see the difference.  The Cruiser
is an order of magnitude better in off-highway ability.

I saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was
wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me.

Namely:  1.  Does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)?
	 2.  Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult?
	 3.  One power window and the power seat do not work, are these

One of the reasons I sold my '92 Civic VX was the chattery-grabby clutch
although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because
its always humid around here.  I was told by Honda that it has to do with
changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990.
Someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's
legal to manufacture them these days.  My feeling is that since many other
car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering
problem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Honda
products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.

It isn't that bad.  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared
to the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12
(thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore
Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
development.  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in
today's world.  Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to
take over part of Ferrari as well...

That's funny.  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'. 
:-)

Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s
(from the VF-400F through the VF-1000F, including the RC30 race bike and
the present VFR-750F).  It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in
recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.

VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps.  Also, VW
uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well, although I don't know the
mechanics of it.

Many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.

It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions.

Agreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and
the AT.  In the past, I've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned
an Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the

In a previous article, gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W. Mahan) says:

>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.

It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd. 

To calculate drag use this formula:

D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S

Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),
V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the
pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). 

Note that power is:

P = F * v

Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v
is velocity (ft/s). 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for
force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. 

So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top
speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)

101 mph

Sorry to dissappoint.

The accelerating from a stop shouldn't be ""doggy"" because of the light

Shaz,

Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:
  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car. The computer will actually ""sense"" how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
  
  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again.

So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a 
surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.

Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.

PS.  my initial question is ""how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW""

I agree about the durability of the old TH400 trannies from GM.  While I 
never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave 
the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires 
grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would 
shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double 
stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite 
impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.
Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large
chains.  Oh yea,FYI:    Pontiac 400 ci bored 0.04 over

 A 68 Corvette but, I don't want to put Corvette seats in it.  The original
 seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  I'm going to
 store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but
 I'm looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but 
 cushion height and overall width are a concern.  I've looked through some
 local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of 
 cheapo's to use this summer.

You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid.

Like they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.

I can put a 32valve V-8 with twin Garret-4s on Yugo and get 7.7sec QM.
Thats useless ... Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track,
or on the street.

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of
the 5.0 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 (I ll buy it in 6 mos) ?

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

   I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars.  They stink!  And it's always
 roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family.

   I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.  So the 
 invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.  Yeah,
 well so what!?  Someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and,
 as far as I am concerned, those kind are just as bad.

    I am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.  It'll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner, too.

I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock
sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have
on my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,
but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It
works great.

The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust
it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without
setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the
Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false
alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has
been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's
cause and it was not a false alarm.

I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight
in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are
supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't
have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm
won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.

This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on.

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to
people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. 
The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.
> 
> I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems

> 
I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune
it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable
the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the
alarm is armed/disarmed.  

I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine
flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be
careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your
keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are
meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.

I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but
more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. 
The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)
than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good
value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. 
Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. 
Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they
had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>

V4s? I don't know of any. I4s and flat4s are abundant.

>V6 - Legend, MR3? MR6?

A whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the
subcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few
exceptions).

I6s are much more rare now; the only one I personally know of that's
still in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the F-series pickups.
I think that Jeep's big 6's are also straight sixes, but I'm not a

Where are you to not know of V8s? There are Mustangs, Cadillacs,
Lincolns, Camaros, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, all real full-size
pickups, Crown Vics, Chevy Moby^H^H^H^HCaprice ;-), and even a few

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

I think you mean ARPA; AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons,
and I seriously doubt that they'd want young whippersnappers building
anything on their backbones, what with de-calcification and all :-)

>to identify the type of organisation.  Internet extended the convention for
>other countries, but the US retained the old conventions.

The general convention is that if it doesn't have a country tag on it, it's
a US site. That includes:
	.com	commercial 
	.edu	educational 
	.mil	US Military sites 
	.gov	US Gov't non-military sites (eg NASA sites)
	.org	anyone who is ""none of the above""
There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites, but they will have
the country extension (eg xxxx.edu.au is an extension I saw today).
US sites can also use the .us extension, but, as Mr. Smith pointed 
out, the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone, and they default
to US sites if there's no country code.

I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this (or wants to know
more about it on a non-system-administrative level) check out
the book _The_Whole_Internet_User's_Guide_and_Catalog_ by Ed Krol.
(or is it Catalog and User's Guide? I can never remember, and my copy
is my desk at home...). It's a very good not-necessarily-technical
guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it (including
USENET). I don't think it's part of the Nutshell series, but it is
published by O'Reilly and Associates.

This should go to one of the news.* newsgroups, but damned if I
can figure out which one.... :-)

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is

There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of
engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired
of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year
old BMW is still as sweet as it was new.

But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow.
I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I
still try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through
blizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design
flaw in the BMW.

Wouldn't you rather have some type of standard ""electrical"" plug instead of 
that ""fire hazard waiting to happen"" adaptor? I know I would, and I would 
also prefer to have sensibly placed cup holders instead of an ashtray. (my 
car came with coin holders already built in)

Actually, that'd be 155 mph and 60 mph (the legal speed limit for trucks) 
in *two* lanes, each direction. It's a hell of a rush when those trucks fly

I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement. 
I see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been
releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers?
Where did you learn logic?

As for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS
seats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets
and that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.

Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above.
It hurts.

Damn straight! As far as I've heard, unless the owner is _very_
hard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere
mortals could afford.

>And maybe the Mustang
>will be forever King of the Road, the GT-40 isn't road legal.

I think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular
question is moot (see the price figures below).

>This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does
>a GT-40 go for? How many were made?

I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40
registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made 
(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65),
and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a
GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of ;-).

I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although
I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, 
and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They
also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was
rear-engine, rear-drive, with the ""bundle of snakes"" exhaust
headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I
can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby
Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early '70's - a local show winner!
Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt &
dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise
ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent.
The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is
priced at $12,000.

1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work,
but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and
carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.

1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good
for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make
a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the
upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the '70's.  The top was
new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500.

All three cars will be sold ""as they stand"" with no hassles or haggles.
Time has passed by and it is time to part company.  Prices are negotiable.

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles
for the orthodox inline 4, they are using a horizontally opposed 4,
which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat
six in their 911, so what's the problem?  i don't see any claim that
their engine is as good as a porsche's.. they are simply pointing out
that they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to
nitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than
this.

         Call around to some wrecking yards in your area and,if they have

Hello all,

I know that after market sunroofs may have left a bad taste in some of  
your mouths, but I am really interested in finding a ""good"" brand if one  
exists.  Please let me know if you have heard of any makers with a good
reputation (few failures, no leaks, that sort of thing) and whether or
not you have had first hand experience with that manufacturer.  Who is
generally regarded in the industry as the ""best"" (price no object) maker  
of power sunroofs??

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last
May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes
the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed
manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my
truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""

Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the
gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about
55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,
the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should
point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They
dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity""
reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times 
so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off).

Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new
Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never
buy another Chevrolet.

A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am
interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn.  The
reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  The car's owner
claims the car is in good condition.  My question is: how
reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that
I should look out for?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Post responses and/or
e-mail me.

i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical ""accident.""

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you.
that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
which may be more indicative of claim patterns.

       I just had my rotors on my '92 Taurus GL changed less than 500 miles
   ago and...you guessed it, I'm noticing slight warpage in the left rotor.
   :-(  I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a
   high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem.  This is a brand new
   rotor bought from a Ford Dealership.  Can't they even produce a brand new
   rotor that is not warped?  I'm currently negotiating with them to swap it
   out for a new rotor.

       This is my first American build car and I'm not overly impressed.

On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in
their Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I
played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of
us bought a 1967 ""tranny"" to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible
shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent
days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til
the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
pig shit came flying out the vents!!!.
    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that
thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and
it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls
on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.
    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
Morris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories.

Talk to Philip Greenspun. He took Ford to court recently and, despite much
manouvering and trickery on Ford's part, he won! Well, actually I think
Ford settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped 
causing them trouble. I love it when the little guy wins. I don't have
Philip's address anymore, but a ""Philip, where are you"" call may bring him
out of hiding.

He made no allegations, and specifically gave the seller the benefit of the
doubt.  He simply made the net aware of the fact that many of these seats are
stolen, so watch out and ask questions when buying.  That's good advice to
follow when buying _anything_ from a third party, on the net or elsewhere.

If everything I've read is correct, Ford is doing nothing but ""re-
skinning"" the existing Mustang, with MINOR suspension modifications.
And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
of it.  

The ""new"" mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a 20 year old car.

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.
It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself. 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.
Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. 
Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and
extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. 
I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed
the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,
air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.
After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.

Good luck!

This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in
water, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth.
Many people have used it. It is very easy to work with and gives
seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax.

But, does it last long? Does it have any negative effects to car

	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just
a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650
front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable
and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)
2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out
of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were 
free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers
i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,
but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear
axels, ford 9"" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i 
busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and 
haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to 
rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones
that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly
TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were
as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective
wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few
dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were
discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top

I doubt his trans uses standard syncros.  There are several mechanisms for
coupling a gear with the transmission output shaft, some of which are fine
for racing and unsuitable for street use.

They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new

Interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG
design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve

just out of curiosity, how is this ""dog clutch"" any different from a synchro
transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""
and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

We all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to

 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the
 cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving
 conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and
 had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight
 oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).

I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except when
having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of
freeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative
maintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents
that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the
system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless
you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for
your info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for
flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't
know if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.

Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?)
Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,
by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure
on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem
as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).
There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop
should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

Not only the Sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V-4 from Ford of Germany.  This particular
motor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
ports.  This motor was later stretched into the V-6 commonly seen in the
Capri.

The V-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  But in the
Saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been
designed for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.

	Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest;


Toyota 4runner:

Nissan Pathfinder:
	
	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has
	a cheap-looking interior.

Isuzu Trooper:

	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,
	handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge,
	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10""
	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.


Chevy Blazer:

	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still 
	too small.

Ford Explorer:

	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would
	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and
	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,

	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10"" shorter
	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual 
	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. 


	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?

Whoa!  Watch your terminology.  ""Dealer invoice"" is *not* ""dealer cost"".
You'll hear lots of ads screaming ""two dollars over dealer invoice!!!""
Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the ""dealer invoice""
(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers
on it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers
signify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the
salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere
on the ""invoice"" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and
most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,
low voice saying something like ""invoice may not reflect actual
dealer cost"".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual
dealer cost.

Also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent.
Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that
you want.  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of
""dealer prep"" and ""protection package"" (i.e. a few squirts of
paint and fabric protectant).  While you're at it, ask the salesman
to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.  My

I've not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but
do get the squeal that Bill describes.  I live in Seattle so the wet weather
may be a factor.

This is true.  I'm wondering if this may be a safety concern.  IE, if people
pound on the place where the airbag lives...

The 5 speed is much more fun.  We opted for the automatic for a number of

Agree. Check it out.  I don't mind it but would say that if it was much

I've had this problem and read about it.  (or at least I assume the one
I had was the one I read about :-).  In any case what happened was the
weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it (ok, so I'm not a mechanic)
broke.  In my case the dealer welded it, ordered replacement parts and
put them on when they got them.  I suspect this is some sort of 1) design
flaw, or 2) production flaw.  In any case I have an earlier model and would

I second this.  There seems to be some things that slipped through but the
car seems very sound.  While not perfection (what is) you get an awful

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my
personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this
one, too).  

While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out
slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into
position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the
gears grind.... You will just glide back.

	My neighbor runs a Viper(R) distributorship and installs them on all
Saturns sold in my area (Anne Arundel County, MD).  He has an SC with the
Viper voice alarm installed.  The alarm does everything, turn on the car, 
the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors...  The alarm goes
off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by.  It gets sensitive up
to about 5 feet in 85degree heat.  It isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms,
because it doesn't continue to wail, it just says ""Protected by Viper, please
stand back!""  And shuts up...  (mainly because the person walks away

I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own
question?  Is the reflected signal ""shifted"" at all from the
act of being reflected?  If so, wouldn't it then be easy for
the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
sources?

It seems that there are more and more ""bands"" available for
police radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within
the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect
detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  

Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and
read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of
the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors
was touted as covering.  

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all
the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the
new Super Ka wideband.  

Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for
the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is
now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense
to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my ""new"" detector?
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be 
worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the 
market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the
3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had
inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler
when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best
equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar 
bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.

Hello again.

Anyone here done any tinting work.  What are the best brands out there?
How about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s
you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.

Also I would consider having it professionally done, how much around
Wisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid)

Thanks for all the info...

Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature
Coolant Temperature
Manifold Vacuum
Ammeter, Voltmeter

Fuel Pressure [maybe] (Problematic, since you either need an electronic
sensor/gauge pair or you have to mount the damn thing outside the car)

In addition, it'd be nice to have a big red idiot light 'Check Guages'

Voltmeter.  With heaps of guages, it's hard to look at them all all

Some GT-40s are street legal, some aren't.

>>This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does
>>a GT-40 go for? How many were made?

I found my Shelby-American guide. There were a grand total 126 GT-40s
built:
		GT-40 Coupes		55
		GT-40 Road Cars		31
		GT-40 Mk II		13
		GT-40 Mk IIIs		 7
		GT-40 Roadsters		 5
		Mirages			 3
		GT-40 Mk IVs		12
		   	TOTAL:	       126
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	6-12

Twelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;
eight Mk II coupes; 4 LHD Mk IIIs; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs. The other 
breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.

The prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million
mark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or
thereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that
was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing
team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory
broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.

Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of
this information comes from ""Hot Rod"" magazine's ""Shelby American
Cobra/Mustang Guide,"" which has more info on the Shelby-American 
Fords than you could _ever_ want to know.

Well, you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every
4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. The local acura
dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon, i.e. May/June.

Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from
most of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia
as well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation
in Europe. Normally you can see new Japanese models appear in Europe
or Japan first and extrapolate from there. C+D reported that the engine
would be a carryover I think.

Ehhhh, maybe. The '93 Mustang Cobra does a good job for a lower price,
and it's just a taste of what's ahead in the 30th Anniversary of
the original Pony Car.

DON'T BUY IT!  All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches
later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably
know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady
character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good
but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you
would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more.
Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many
miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but
you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it
could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this
isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $
5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has
legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who
has been taken a couple of times. Good luck.

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.

>Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.

>And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
>Hello , this is the 90 's ?

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

The last V8 in Mad Max is based on a Holden (Australia). Holden is

Are you serious?  The auto that had a lot to do with bringing the term

Eve'.

I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't
have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does
anyone have any experience with the following brands?

	Riken
	Falken	
	BFG	
	General	

There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like
I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I
hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that
""noone will give you warranty on such tires"", according to
a tire dealer?

Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again),
or is that strictly a speed factor?

Funny, I thought the numbering scheme for both Lexus and Infiniti was
related to sticker price more than anything else, i.e. Infiniti G20 (around
20K), Q45 (around 45K), Lexus ES250 (RIP) (around 25K), Lexus ES300 (around

It was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody
awful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit
van.

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph.

re: extended Ka bands.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm
nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:

- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,
  ""Ka stands for K automatic""... duuhh.  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.

- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
  even the real sneaky ones.

- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.

So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high
performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.

That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get.  
The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  
probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory   
kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume  
at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but  
it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays

Hello everyone,

Allstate insurance

SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person 
reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost 
exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is ""totalled"" because of 
exceeding repair costs.
Person says ""WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!"" and takes it to 
another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the 
dealer.
One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred 
in Pennsyvania.

QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this,

Ford aimed for 75% US content when they designed the new Probe. In actual
practice it came out to 77% US content. If my '89 is any example the 23%
that is imported may be the engine and brakes, at least the '89 had
Missybitchy brakes.

justify all you want.  extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for
the dealer.  and you didn't buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you
bought is 2yr/24k.  and you still have to pay $50 every time you use this 
great 'warranty'.  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs
if/when you need it.  considering that your last car was only 1.5 years old,
are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's *free* warranty period?
btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around 80%.  that's right, only
20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future
repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.

good point.  you would think by now that most car companies would just make
4 wheel disc standard and be done with it.  can it really cost that much more
for disc?  especially when you think of the economies of scale they would gain
by just making them all 4 wheel disc.  no seperate parts numbers and orders 
etc.  btw, the z28 and trans am and formula have 4wheel disc, but the bottom
line models have the rear drums.

Subject: '88 Corolla 5spd.

Hi there, maybe you can help me...

I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearbox
seems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also 
somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as
bad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could it
just be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid.
Or am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also have
an old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...

Thanks,
Derek

Well, the Opel deal fell through...

Now i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy&sell.  Any
previous owners have any experience with these cars?  Besides looking
for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car
things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that
I should watch out for?

How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars
look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing
resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one
of the most beatiful cars ever made.

What is the difference between 240Z, 260Z, 280Z?  The 280ZX is rather 
unappealing IMHO, but the other cars are decent.
Thanks again...

All gimmicks!  Stick with plain 'ol carnauba wax that's non-abrasive.
Eagle 1, Meguiars, Turtle Wax, and a few others are good examples.
The colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so 
apparent.  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely
off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.

Never tried Liquid Glass, although I still have this sample they sent
me a few years back.
