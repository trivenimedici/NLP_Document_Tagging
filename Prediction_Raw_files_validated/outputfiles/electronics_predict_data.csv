Probably won't help.  I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer
used those little self-contained modules.  I think Sharp made them.
Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)

The module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  It
contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator
all in a tiny metal can.

If you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can
probably order one.  BTW - the carrier frequency is 40 KHz, and each
different TV/VCR/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse
scheme to perform each different function on their equipment.

You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not
interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal
you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an
all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's
heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks
that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the
properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at
that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not
unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things
in realtime if you write efficient code.

In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)
filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out
there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs.

Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and
give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they
charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.

I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are
built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"".

>What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments?

    Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
(octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the same
amount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave.
    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
(Hz, kHz, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount of
noise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide).
    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave
filter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs).
Note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network 
:-(
    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.
It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)
as a flat line across the bands.

Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in

Pink noise is a random signal with more low-frequency components
than white noise.

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency
analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which
means that every frequency is present in the noise signal.

Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass
filtering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more
low-frequency components.

The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring
animals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will
explain you why.

Enjoy it.

They do interpolate - it's not linear interpolation though. You are correct
that the frequency content is not altered (more specifically, the baseband
spectrum is preserved, and so is every Nth image spectrum. The other
(N-1) in N image spectra are removed, where N is the oversampling rate)

>you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an

Ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0Hz to 22050Hz, and a gain of 0
from 22050 to the new Nyquist frequency. In practice a finite transition
band is required, and there is also a certain amount of pass-band ripple
and stop-band leakage. With a high order (eg 200 taps) digital filter,
a very good approximation can be easily achieved.

No, they actually use a digital FIR just like yours, but built in hardware,

I guess that the answer is somewhere between the two.

As an interesting (?) aside, some of you out there may be aware of a scheme
used by Pioneer and Wadia, which is called (by Pioneer, at least) Legato
Link. I haven't heard one of these players, but by reading advertising
blurb, and a couple of pseudo-technical articles I deduced that all they
do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter, and let a load of the
first image (ie aliassed) spectrum through. Talking to Bob Stuart (of
Boothroyd Stuart, aka Meridian) confirmed my suspicion. He said that it
sounded awful, but then he would, wouldn't he...

This would be susceptible to fading, multi-path etc. We used to use a
system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa. It used a
10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured.
The 10 GHz was just the carrier: the real signals were several switched
ones around 7.5 MHz or so, whose relative phases at the receiver would
read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. The units
came with psychrometers (sp?) to measure the relative humidity and
instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp.
They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end.
Current technology uses polarized reflectors, dual polaization TX/RX
and psuedo-random coding of a radar pulse. about the same resolution
at X band, much better at 47GHz. (Only one end is heavy :-)  ).

Very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate
distances ... might be more interesting than my application.  Just a thought,
you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote
control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse.  A Hamamatsu
detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give
the current position.  Store and collate this on a computer and you could
replay the movements on the screen.  Interesting!

There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the
user is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is
for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on
(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different
machine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  

The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends
on the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user 
did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.
No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!

I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's 
conscience should do that.

I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of ""casual""
users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights
(It's the truth.  I have ""friends"" who ask me for copies of my latest games
all the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual
pirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will
discourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my ""friends"" dug up
somewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual
release!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable
the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined
pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread 
that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once
found by authorities.  It is the ""casual"" pirates that the copy protection is
determined to discourage.

What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.
Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus
violated their license agreement.

This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal 
discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only
problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.

The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore
gains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,
the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is 
supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not 
supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,
a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?

>-- 

One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask
you for a word from page x, line y, and word z, but this is pitifully simple to
remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program, and
some self-rewriting code to confuse some people.  Also, make sure that your
program can not be run out a debugger.

Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,
just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,
you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.
Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with
garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in
some random sector.

Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they
are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the
opposite of what you want.

Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the
machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can
think of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it
requests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should
be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything
else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once
again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC
checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other
things, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a
change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the
program.  Tell them the program is ""VIRUS SECURE"", and remember, you have
helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.

I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can't
do it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in
the process!). Goodbye.

What is the program that will be sold?

Well, yes and no.  The _image_ can't be on the screen less than 1/30
of a second, but a _mixture_ of images that's about 90% of the field
that was supposed to be there and 10% of the 'subliminal' addition
could be overlaid for one field, producing the same overall effect to
our sluggish retinae of a discrete image projected for 1/300 second.

..although, like the previous poster, I have to reserve my doubts
about the effectiveness of said discrete image in steering my
subconscious around ..

You might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. They
work best for close work( 1 mile and under).

RF is used for much longer distances in two major modes. Transponder and
phase measurment. Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station
and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the
receiver time.

Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the
same frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and
measure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the
Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two
stations.

Oh, yeah.  This is a fine place.  We haven't had the ""why does concrete
kill lead-acid batteries"" thread in at least six months.

The concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains
them into the ground.

Another explanation, implausible as it is,  is that the lead-acid battery
needs to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery
self-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction.

Naawwwww.... the concrete sucks the life out.

	Some TV's, including my RCA set at home, uses simple carriers
which I think run between 32 and 36 or 38 KHz.  There is no tone decoding
in it.  All one has to do to piss the thing off :-) is just hook an
IRLED up to a variable oscillator and tune through.  Wreaks all kinds

	Similarly, my VCR remote changes channels on my cable box.  Always
seems to change the cable box to channel 5 when you do the pause/play.

	SOOOO, some things do have some overlap to them.

You should be clear in your mind what your goal is. Two possible goals
are (1) maximizing you income from your program, and (2) minimizing
the number of illegal copies which get created. Accomplishing (2)
doesn't usually accomplish (1).

Most vendors have concluded that copy protection reduces the number of
normal legitimate sales by far more than it increase sales by virtue
of changing 'copiers' to 'purchasers', and hence merely reduces
revenue.  Most legitimate buyers nowadays (including me) have had bad
experiences with copy protected products (e.g., hard to make a
legitimate backup, incompatabilties when new system on system upgrade,
etc.), and they won't touch them with a ten foot pole.

>Yes. It's called RADAR.
Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances
by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its
reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters
use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of
the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,
the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500
feet altitude.

Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster
originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between
a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate
time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter
triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually
travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference
is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a
common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something
like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both
the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,
but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.

Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again
the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.
should know about anyway ;-).

>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength

This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter
varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission
line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit
over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With
the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at
one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for
the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...

>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in

Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.
This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.
Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...

>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance
attenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies
around 4 GHz.

Hope this helps...

Not entirely true. A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game
GODS and asked me for help since he could not find a ""trainer"" (small
patch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed but
I did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file
would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the ""shield"" in the
game from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.

There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or
another and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copy
protection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,
compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly
compressed), dongles, key disks, etc...

I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection
schemes.

Okay, so what do you do if some part of the machine (presumably the part  
on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself  
upon goes bad, you replace that part, and now your program won't run  
because it's on a ""different"" computer???

This is, of course, assuming that the program uses something in ROM (like  
the BIOS serial number, maybe?) and not a disk-based code number.   
Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.

I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.   
We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  
machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of  
over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  
with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  
admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  
than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  
your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   
""Pirate board"" or no pirate board.  I too have ""friends"" who blatantly and  
quite successfuly ""hack"" copy protection schemes practically in their  
sleep.

Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  
machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  
setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  
mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  
administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  
(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and ""acting"" similar to  
the average user, and maintaining ""behind-the-scenes"" consistency is a  
real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  
different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  
disk.

Often we have hardware problems at peak ""business"" times and have to do  
some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .

Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..

The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  
files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  
to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  
COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  
machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  
ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  
this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  
all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.

Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  
to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  
usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  
the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with ""copy  
protection"" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  
 . .

In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  
of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  
you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  
guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  
REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  
the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  
please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  
costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  
legitimate user with a ""copy protection"" scheme!


Sorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . .. :-)

Hello,

Can somebody tell me what kind of MOV's are most useful for a computer

a 10A current and the other for 20A.  On the other hand, commercial surge
protectors I have seen claim a clamping voltage of 330V-400V, which SEEMS to
me in imply a rated voltage of about 250V (250V * SQRT(2.)=353).

What is the right kind?

While at it, ow important is really the EMI/RFI module?  Is there really any

Funny . . . I and most of the detector-owning friends I have, are  
generally able to *REMEMBER* such things as nearby microwave towers and  
radar detectors going off in EXACTLY the same spon EVERY DAY . . ..

I know on I-64 at the Grayson, KY exit, there's a store just off the side  
of the road (think it's a Liquor store . . .) with what must be a security  
system that would make most federal prisons proud.  It's the only thing  
I've ever driven by (besides a cop) that puts my Whistler in ""Oh my God  
he's Right Behind You!!!!"" mode . . ..  I simply ignore the detector and  
use my eyes when I drive by that store . . . 40 seconds later, all's quiet  
on the front and no problem.

I strongly disagree. I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't
copy the program if ""diskcopy"" can't do it.
If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will
suffice.
I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*
because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.

Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
backup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a waste
of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to ""lend""
out the backups. 


No flames intended - just my thoughts.

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.

The same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the
bonnet (US: ""hood"") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.

The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with
WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the 
battery off the ground may help.  I'm not sure if spraying with WD-40
would be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).

Just a thought...

I am not a battery expert, but from recent reading, a lead acid battery
will self discharge at a relatively high rate, and if stored in a discharged
state, will develop a condition I think is called sulfation.  In storage,
either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance
I'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle
charge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable
if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.
The refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the
charging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.  Some of this may
only apply to Gel type cells, but I suspect the same applies to the liquid
type.

Zilog SCC:
---------
	RR0[7]:  Break Detect

This is a very popular part, but it has a number of quirks, especially
in HDLC mode.

Signetics 68562 DUSCC:
---------------------
	RSR[2]:  Break Start Detect
	RSR[3]:  Break End Detect

Two of the bits in the Receiver Status Register.  You can enable an interrupt
on either of these bits going high, too.  Also, only one NULL will be put
in the FIFO per break detected.

This is simply the best serial chip I've ever worked with.  _Many_ less
quirks than the SCC, which is IMHO second-best.  (Death to 8250 devices!)

It had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood):
the TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list
that as the CIA complex interface adapter.)  TIA stands for Television
Interface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.

>Later model 2600

Not according to the servicing documentation I have here.  The 2600 did not
change intenally very much at all.

>Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for
>their games. 

ROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space.  2K and 4K
games were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching.  Atari
(and others) made much of these ""huge"" cartridges.

>I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I
>would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. 

Wrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT.  This was multiply mapped into
both page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the
bottom 4K of memory.  TIA registers also sat in this address space.

As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried
RAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line
to the cart.  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address
range, and the writes into another, but all the time this scheme ate into
the *very* scarce ROM address space.

I would expect that CD-ROM software would not even need copy protection.
As the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is
impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a
CD-ROM, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made.

Hmmm.. now that I think about it.. with a creative TSR, maybe
disk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. You
would need a tonne of disks though.

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem
to remember that PeP is actually 4x the ""real"" power.  Which makes 1KW PeP
actually around 250W.  Or was it 2x?  I disremember.

""Effective transmitted power"" is also ""odd"", in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry.  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron
might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
CN tower ;-).

This is like Sears HP ;-)

Though, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible.  About 125-150A with
a 12V alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages.

It's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies).  You'll
feel it when you hit the key.  But not too much.

Just MHO, but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
of them open spread across the bed (next to the desk in my dorm) and  
reference them while using the program full-screen.  The Windows Help  
things come closest to good on-line documentation I've seen, but they  
generally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
space (even compressed) which is at a premium on my system . . ..  In  
fact, the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland's C++ compiler  
instead of using the one the lab licensed (in the lab, of course).  I've  
got a SHELF full of books to help me out when I'm stuck.  :-)   To each  
his own . . . :-)

We've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac 5.0 and  
Word for Windows (may have been a bad batch of disks).  Don't have the  
faintest idea what happened to them, they just went bad.  Weren't stored  
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated, indeed they were only  
used once.  Given this, and the massive headaches finding a working set of  
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down, I'd say  
having working backups is a godsend.  I sure wish we'd had them (Sometimes  
I think Murphy's Law holds true more often than Newton's!!) when we needed  
them.  I think it's sortof like snake antivenin.  99.995% of the time you  
have absolutely no use for it, but when you need it, BOY do you ever need  
it!

I don't have backups of my originals at ""home"" but then my machine doesn't  
see anywhere NEAR the use/abuse of these here at the lab, and so I  
consider it less of a risk.  Still, I usually make ""working copies"" of  
them when I install them and then eventually re-use these ""working copies""  
for something else. . ..

BTW, before anyone notices my mentioning ""copying"" programs from machine

That said, I would definately subscribe to r.r.a.packet if you want to
learn about all aspects of amateur packet radio, at both the high and
low ends.  Also, I would get the FAQ from the group, and then post any
specific questions to that group.  Everything I could tell you is 
probably in the FAQ, and the people who really know what's going on all
seem to be on r.r.a.packet (although they might be here too, you never know :)

Hope it helps...

Radio-Electronics sends each company a bunch of computer-printed address

The company sends whatever it wants to -- normally a catalog.

This topic was beaten to death a year or so ago.

The concrete is not the problem. 

Lead-acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long
time), but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
problem.

For those who would like to know, the 6507 was a 6502 without IRQ or NMI,
and with only 13 address lines (giving 8K memory space).

Didn't know about it being called the 6526 - thats the CIA found in the
Commodore 64 (I don't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around).
The TIA was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in the
bottom 128 bytes of page 1. To get an image on the screen, you had to wait
until the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line
into the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many
duplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This
took all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the
display.

>There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage
>regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.

The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page
1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is
both shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a
machine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it
also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the
high byte of the address is hardwired to 1).

The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers
(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the
6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I
think this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so
many games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do
something else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.

There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at
least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I
imagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly
to chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so
the 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly
normal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more
usual active low chip select.

You take two copies with a different registration id, compare them byte for

I once wrote such a program (in BBC basic...) It was very crude, and took

If you want to write one, just store the prefered values in an array, and

I think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is
not being charged or discharged. I remember some advice from an ancient car
manual guide my father had, which was to use car batteries to power a garage
clock or something similar when they're not in a car. This is supposed to 
prevent the oxidation but I've no idea if it really works. The concrete floor
connection is a red herring.

Yes, but still not a 6502 for those differences.  Same instruction set,
of course.

Yes, the same number, but an entirely different device.  I should have
qualified this further by stating that this was the PAL version of the TIA -
I am not 100% sure that the NTSC TIA would have a different number.

Does anyone on the net actually have details of the TIA, as this is the only
device I have not yet discovered details about?  Atari Australia, when asked,
claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the 2600
had failed, as the US head office had refused to provide it.

I saw a couple of cheaper devices with PN2222's and a couple of resistors
hooked up as a cheap inverter.  Nasty, but workable, and cheaper than a
7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing.

See if Radio Shack has a National Semiconductor Adjustable Voltage

rated for an input to output differential of up to 35 Volts @ 3 Amps.

Digi-Key Corp. has these parts, as well as several other useful regulators.
If you don't have their catalog, their phone number is: 1-800-344-4539.

I can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 7.5 VDC nicad battery 
with this device, and if I'm right, you may want to look through some of the 
hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits, first.

If you get stuck, e-mail me your FAX number, if you have one, and I'll send 
you some suggestions or schematics.

Back in high school I used to work for a detailing company, and one of the
services we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil BEFORE you
sell the car...  ;-}). Unfortunately, we did not have a high pressure
washer so we would use one several miles from the shop. On more than one
occasion after washing the engine, it would not start as water would have
gotten under the distributor (I would put a plastic bag around it to try and
minimize this), around the spark plug wires, etc and it would be nearly
IMPOSSIBLE to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. The usual
solution was to carry a can of WD-40, and when the car wouldn't start to spray
all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.

It may be a myth, but it certainly kept me from being stranded at a car wash...

	Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators
	and learn the ""black magic"" art of switching power supplies...
	(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)

	Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty
	good results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems
	when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious
	amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my
	bench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as 
	the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)
	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.
	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
	the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose
	me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full
	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd
	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
	low volume :-)

	My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are
	1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)
	Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on my
	own (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take any
	course that covers transistors ;-)

	So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercial
	models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what
	I'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematics
	and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? 

	Take care.

	P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and
	(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8A
	and -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will be
	more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.
	Would like to have a working model in a year or so... :-)

What happens is that (I heard this discussed on ""Northern Exposure"") there  
is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the  
molecules in the concrete.  This acts as an attractant to UFOs (actually  
their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete  
combination.

Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES!

Remedy:  Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.

There is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound,
or in your words, ""it DOES have a bearing on...."".

Now, I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination
stove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan,
but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature
variation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  And since
junction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimental
effect on linearity.  

a few facts:
-bias points vary with temperature
-junction resist varrie with temp
-Adcom products do NOT run class-A

If you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirements
for most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifier
warm-up.  On many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes for
the output stage, many hours for the drivers.  Fortunately the drivers
are not switched.

In any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening,
betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias
(idle current) level.  Both have a positive correlation with low
distortion and ""good"" sound quality, and high bias results in
warmer operation, all other factors being equal.

The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional
or not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or
input presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively
coupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and
from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any
coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.

If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than
just coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before
switching with coupling capacitors of your own.

If you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input
through to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching
where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch
change. This may mask the switch click.

An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and
making your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)
sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles
use this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes
a complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.
Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.

For a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try 
looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its
older predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed
prior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete
and IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).
All the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily
make a subject for a multi-page article.

Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on
due to charge being injected into the audio line through device
capacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to
minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through
the switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the
control pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as
putting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.

Hope this helps at least get you started.

	This is not a good idea.. I upgraded my motherboard last fall.  I
would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to
reinstall simply because I changed motherboards.

	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum.  Are you
going to require that a user re-install all their software if they add 4Mb
of RAM to their computer?  I did that a couple of weeks ago.  It's in the
BIOS, and if software had told me ""this isn't the machine you installed me
on"" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad idea.

> I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's

	This is silly.  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give
them that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.

> You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable

	Do you know any assembly language at all?  All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction
to just completely skip it.  Not that difficult, really!  And there is very
little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.  Using PKLITE or
some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE
were tagged as uncompressable.

	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post.  Making it
plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. But, the
determined ones are just going to answer ""Joe Blow"" to the question of
""what's your name"" so this won't stop them in the long run.

	Pirates are always going to win this fight.  They simply have more
time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme.

IN ORDER to get the 15 nS response time you need, you are better off 
going to an ECL slicer which can run off a single +5 or -5.2 V supply, 
you just need to bias or do some level shifting perhaps to get it in the 
range. Check out the ECL 10K books for a simple cheap solution.

You can design for ramp shutoff, brick-wall current limit or even 
fold-back cutoff....sounds like you want ""BRICK-WALL"" current limit.

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base 
drive. In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on 
the current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing 
resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense 
the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to 
turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  Phase compensation 
may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more 
than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK??

WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you 
need a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 
resitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the 
error of 1% to cope with. 
You have 3 choices;
a) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low 
sensitivity designs
b) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (Vishay/Dale)
c) use trimmers or SOT's (Select-On-Test)

The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold.  The temperature
combined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of 
the battery.  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't
go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite
cooler.

The color of the board shows the composition of it, hence the use of it.

Original and older boards were bakelite composition, and were brown.
Phenolic (spelling) was a tan
Most ""non filled"" fiberglass boards used in computers are green.
Filled fiberglass is blue.
Teflon is white.

As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them.  First boards were
used mainly in audio circuitry.  Couldn't be used in high voltage or RF because
it would arc and burn.  Most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen
by its use and cost.  

Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the
fiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a 
capacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the
high frequencies.

Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections
is a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of
the vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses.  Camcorders use this
to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.

Am working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board
is gold plated, boy it looks expensive!!!

Hope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read.

My education was pre-transister!

    Hello, I'm looking for information on Alphanumeric pagers

I would go about building a device to decode the paging data 
(like my pager does) and feed it though an RS232 port.
    I'm planning on seperating different paging messages and 
different pagers in software to keep amount of hardware I need 
down....  Does anyone know what chips (Motorola?) are good for 
decoding Numeric and Alphanumeric paging data (and then stuffing
it down an RS232 port (basically any baud rate is fine!) ? 
    (I already have a radio reciever with headphone level

I'm glad to see this idea come up because I've had something similar in mind.
What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address 
data.  When the user registers, you don't even need to send executable code, 
just compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the 
appropriate place the following:

Name=Joe Doe
Address=123 Main Street
City=Anytown, CA
key=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd

Every user needs a unique key.  The executable can propagate as much as you 
like, the author can respond to the registration by e-mail, post card, 
whatever.  Unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else's name 
showing up (maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message).  
Authorized users can make as many copies as they like, upgrade their 
machines, whatever.  The main motivation here is guilt and irritation at 
seeing someone other than yourself as the ""registered owner"".

It's not the temperature, it's the karma.  You see, dirt has good karma,
since it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared
off and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process.  Being
a karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no
longer able to keep a charge.  Because wood is also good and organic, putting
a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.

The Buddha-nature is in the acid, but it is also in the lead plate.  The
novice asked the master whether the spongy lead had more of the karma or
whether the solid lead had it.  The master handed the novice a 250V B battery,
terminals downward, and thus the novice was enlightened.

Judging by your .sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge.
Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available
via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.

Since you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'.
To do this simply:
1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM
burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into
one file yourself with suitable gaps.)
2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game
console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.

To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address'
is simply another address line.

For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would
wire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switches
would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.

If you are just getting sick of the real estate used by the HCT373, you could
always use the approach I have seen one designer take - he stuck the chip in
the middle of the EPROM socket, under the EPROM.  Naturally, you have to use
an IC socket with the right dimensions, but layout is really easy.

Assuming you are refering to standard POTS or ground start lines:

If you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions, the RING
conductor is the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC with respect to
ground while the TIP conductor is at or very near ground potential (be sure
to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements).  

If you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions, the RING
conductor will be the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC while the TIP
conductor would look like it's floating (you may see some potential from
line capacitance it will bleed off over time).  Remember to use the telco
ground as your reference when making measurements.

RAM is something you add all the time, so no.  It's more like BIOS
manufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).  Data cannot be used,
esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette.

On the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as
""Please Insert Original Disk #XX as I need file YYYYYY for update"".  :-) 
It would be perfectly reasonable...  Sort of.

I know x86 and 680x0 assembly quite well, thank you.  I know exactly which
two bytes need to be changed, I have the code to do them too.  I just said
""Don't ask me which ones.""  I didn't say I don't know what that means.

Such hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti-patching code which
does a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match
value stored (encrypted, of course) in the program.  It could be claimed
as a part of anti-virus code, and it would not be far from the truth.

Did ANYONE read what I wrote?  That is NOT what I wrote! (or meant!)  

What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the
restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the
manufacturer.  The manufacturer will then supply the
then-proven-legitimate-user with a patch that will disable the restriction
and PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the ""Registered to XXX"" screen.

> > Pirates are always going to win this fight.  They simply have more

Of course they will, but that was NOT my point.  The purpose of copy
protection is to discourage casual pirates (""Oh, can I have a copy of
that?""/""Sure, here."") and the less sophisticated pirates (""Let's look for
all those calls to INT13H..."") .  Any one determined enough to break copy
protection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entire
load-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to make
such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses
(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.  Pirates who see copy
protection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy
protection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped.  How many
of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us?  Not that many.

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. That's
why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast ---- it insulates the battery
thermally. It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will
self-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to ""shallow-
cycle"" the charge in the battery. Such mild ""exercising"" of a lead-acid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storage
containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells
when you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new battery
in a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an older
battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   
storage.

I don't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the
battery.

However, you would have been better off leaving them outside. Keeping
them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside.
A warm battery will self-discharge faster than a cold one.

When you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a month.
Letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it (I suspect this is
what caused your problems).

And even that doesn't help, there are at least two programs available

There are a number of inaccuracies here:
1) In fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly.  This is why
   batteries should be stored in a COOL, dry place.
2) An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
   on wood.  The battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the
   same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus
   none will effect the other.

There is no need to 'exercise' the battery.  Just keep it charged.  (A trickle
charger will do the job.)

My own practice with new software :

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies.

install to hard drive from second set of floppies.

put originals in a box in room number one.

put copies in box in room number two.

1) Accidents DO happen to original floppies.
2) Accidents CAN happen to the installation floppy.
3) Sometimes software goes out on floppies that are JUST marginally good.  Or
   gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage.

I've had experience with SOMETHING like the last.  I purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor.  THe debugger in the package just would NOT install to the
hard drive. NO WAY.  Repeated floppy-to-floppy copies FINALLY got a clean read
of the disk.  I DON'T recall if I used ""diskcopy"", ""copy/b"", or ""xcopy"".

I made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that.  No problenms ( except with my typing :-)  ) since.

I regard backup floppies as CHEAP insurance.

Just my side of the question...

In order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 2.6 to 2.8 electron Volts. According to my physical
electronics prof, you can't get an LED with that band gap. That's why you
don't find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That
is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found.  I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold,
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering.
They didn't emit very much light...

He's mistaken. They exist, the semiconductor is silicon carbide, and they
are inefficient and expensive. The bandgap is around 2.7 ev.

Most pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate.
A cracked program tends to get passed on, resplendant in the various graphics

I admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving'
copies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use
on one's own PC, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most
spread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had
someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks?

It's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to
use and they feel justified in making a copy since ""someone's already paid
for it"", etc., etc. (A note: this is starting to change a bit. not much
though.)

what about commercially available copy programs? CopyII?
how about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't?
and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy
wouldn't know about this:
  after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that
the 'average' user doesn't know much. Any computer enthusiast is at least
200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down
and use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who
are doing the '20% pirating', not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few

really? I find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster,
but you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you
jump ahead with a search or such. A book, though, you can flip through
faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty

But I partially agree: I often wish I could grep something that was written

what if they need to re-install? The idea of a backup still holds- if

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking 
method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer
in one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with 
pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite
zone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes
away.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional 
to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.
This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.

Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their 
bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.

The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the
Amiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera 
trained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of
view, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events
can be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been
fun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy.
Still, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances,
you can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights,
and I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and
video brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anything
particularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes...

Try a differential amplifier. Put back-to-back diodes between the collectors
restrict the voltage swing. Have 10 mA flow, with 500 ohm collector Rs, and
keep the stray C below 10 pF. Try 2N5179s. Run collector to your logic.

Um...

1) Your Professor if just plain wrong.  Although blue LEDs are one heck of
a lot less efficient than red ones.
2) ""Typical visible light LEDs"" don't really exist.  LEDs have a fairly
narrow region of transmittence.  (Since the Fermi energy around either side
of the band gap falls off exponentially, blah, blah...)

>Source: Solid State Electronic Devices (Ben G. Streetman, 3d ed., Prentice

You might want to check the copyright date on that. :-)

Blue LEDs most certainly do exist, I've got a bunch at work.  Cree Research
makes them (probably along with other companies...  Cree is big in
materials science, though; they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today,
etc.).  You can buy them from JameCo (I think), DigiKey (definitely), and
plenty of other distributors.

Actually, these days you _can_ get a ""typical visible light"" LED -- it's
called a ""rainbow LED"", and I've forgotten who makes it (they advertise in
EDN and many of the other trade rags, though).  It combines a reg, green,
and blue LED all on one chip (and has four leads).  Nifty device, although
it's probably fairly expensive.

Anyone claiming that 1500 ""real watts"" isn't possible in a mobile should
dig through their back issues of 73 (and, I think, QST) for a description
of the mobile installation of that most revered of OMs, W6AM.  As I recall,
this included a Heath 1kW (DC in) amp (what was that model number...SB-
something....  my mind is turning to the usual Friday mush...) and was run 
full-out CW fairly regulary.  The car's electrical system had been modified, 
including a rather seriously-heavy-duty alternator, but such an installation 
HAS been done, and so IS possible.  This installation was the source of
the legendary story of W6AM sitting in the car, and paging his wife over the
department store PA systems!

It isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here, but rather
which is better at transferring the heat out of the (presumably warmer
than ground temperature) battery.  Call it a question of thermal
conductivity, or of insulating ability, or ""thermal mass"" - whatever you

Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;
that's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a 
linearly-regulated power supply would be considered the ""filter"" caps,
coming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a 
transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although
the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT
negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to
get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a
""snubber"" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended
for switcher use today have the diode built in.)

The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in
a somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a
high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or
""filter"") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.
The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,
resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which 
are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs
is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,
which acts in a ""pulse-width modulation"" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying
the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and
therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs
may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less
tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear
regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the 
regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)
is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various
safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be
electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator
to meet this requirement.

While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these
designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can
be ignored; besides the inductive ""kick"" giving the switch transistor a
bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the
energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.
In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,
you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't
saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the 
imagination! :-)).

I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; 
hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors
in the above.

If you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate value
for the typical power dissipation. I'm assuming 2.25 Watts (using the 2.6 W

It's NOT the concrete floor that does it. The problem is that lead-acid
cells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)
will discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells
self discharge even faster. If the battery was not completly charged
when left sitting, it probably discharged past the the point where cell
sulfiding occurs, which in many cases means a ruined battery.

When will people learn!

The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast 
resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to 
store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to 
contact the ballast. 

Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary 
greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in 
fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full 
charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.

If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above 
freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a 
month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, 
DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).

Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like 
electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep 
discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance 
automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure 
shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and 
counting)

     I have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal.  I simply
ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply, +/- 8V in this case.   As long as your
analog input signal stays between the supply rails, the 4066 will work fine.
Of course, your control (logic) input must use -8V as the logic LOW and
+8V as the logic HIGH reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic
must be 4000 CMOS with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide
some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the
control logic.  In my case, I was able to use the bipolar supply all the
way.

     I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response 
to the output from a walkman cassette player. How could I do this?
I don't want it just to turn on, I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak,
per every beep I put on a cassette tape. 

     Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps
on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain
frequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? I'm looking for 
the simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of
color organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...


     I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape.
So on the tape you'd hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc. 
, with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED (
probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with
each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort
of effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the
rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape
(except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!


  Thanks,

I think a few things are being missed overall here... First of all, anyone
with a DOS manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont
go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant) off
of a hard disk. 'Professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks.
They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly
listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number
dialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to
computer games. 
    
Those people are in the minority, however. In my experience with the world of
people and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will
at some point copy a friend's program (""Gee, you really oughta try this"") or
accept a copy. These are people who normally would buy a software package
or do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter.

The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one 
computer; most people aren't going to spend $150 * X# of computers for the
same software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially
things like DOS upgrades.

Are the boards at all intelligent?  (I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,
though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't
decide to talk at the _exact same time_.

Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to ""something""
that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it
used to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS
or slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more
than 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be
able to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)

You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,
though.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4
RS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.

Sorry Charlie...

I have a dozen, VERY blue LED's on my bench right now. They have
a clear plastic case and when lit, are absolutely BLUE. The hue
is sort of a ""summer day cloudless sky blue"" but make no mistake,
they are blue.

You can buy them from Digikey, Circuit Specialist, Jameco (I think),
LED-Tronics, Stanley Optoelectronics, and others. The current price
is around $2.50 each for small quantities. I will also be selling
them through my mail-order company in the near future (4 weeks).

Hmmm...
  A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the
distributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks it
in the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which were
sent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to
track in store piracy.

Possible additional program security schemes would be:
1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in
   and registration. (inconvenient)
2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)
3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness)
4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or
   memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc. 
   (only as effective as above methods at best.)
5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked 
   copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably
   illegal, certainly immoral)

my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thought
if I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.
What is the problem with parallel port security keys? I haven't used anything

To put it bluntly, they are full of it.

Paying a tape is playing a tape.  There is no difference whether the 
output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to 
this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision 
copy protection.)

In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry 
of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow 
magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The 
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.

It is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.
When the SYSOP wanted to, he could have a message sent to the user's end 
saying that it is sending the code to format your HD.)

That's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do.
IMHO it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as
possible AND to sell the customers detail manuals (for the brain-deads)

I suspect either users can't read the manuals or they don't have manuals.
Either way, there is $$$ to be made.   BTW books are quite a bit more

With the popularity of Multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems
(eg. OS0.5, Windoze, Mack System 7), it is pretty easy to run a debugger
and figure out the protection schemes by disassembling/tracing/trapping
the application during run time.  Schemes like compressed software/
special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers.

Hardware keys (unless well designed and *TOTALLY* transparent) is a
pain in the b*t.  We having using a piece of software under Windoze
that uses a hardware key.  The key interfers with the printer stuff
with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software
to work properly.

Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use
the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  Note, though, that
you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it
may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.

The things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that
when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the
film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when
the camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's
standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.

All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables
is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,
and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
another.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery
(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and
pieces from the camera.

I expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really
determined.

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]


   I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.

Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.

  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  
They were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding
lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the 
riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries 
was new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered
that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all
worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced 
about halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored
in the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)
  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.
one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and
discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries
dead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said ""HMMMMMMMM"" and 
the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)
the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They
were the same.  
   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead
acid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only
needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them
by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they
worked fine for around 25 of 'em. 
  This leads me to believe one of several things.
     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)
     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
        batteries.
     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the 
          room where the concrete is, 
     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
         better than concrete.

(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  

   Any other ideas?
    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*

Uh, Bob, why is the battery warmer than ground temperature?  On the time
scales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings
several feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature
difference between the battery and what it's sitting on.

>... Question - why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the 
>surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it?

Because the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is
determined by the balance between internal heat production and external
heat loss.  You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object
(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case
of an object with no significant internal heat production, this will
affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if
it started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final
temperature.

For the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not
whether water will freeze.

Marvin Minsky (hi there) writes of building ""perceptrons?"" in the 1950s using
motor-driven potentiometers to vary the weights. He reported that the circuits
worked even tho there were wiring errors. (Can you say ROBUST?)

Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light. CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID
somewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used. 
Low power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8.
LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at a
few mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil and
eraser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance of
CMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.

Look for information about 567 tone decoder chip. It is an easy to use
chip for detecting sound of certain frequency. You need only one
567 and some other componets for each led you want to control.
The chip can take the voltage levels, which the casette gives.
Radio Shack Archer Semiconductor Reference Guide gives good information
how to use that chip. It should be simplest way to go. The chip costs
something like 1-2 $.

This definately gets the car going, but... WD-40 is highly flammable. Explosive
even in the right conditions, like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for
eg. And contact points tend to arc a tiny bit :)

I once saw the alternator/points cover blow completely off a motorcycle after
it had been restored to life with WD-40... fun to watch
(It was a Honda MR-50 minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber 
grommet, so it wasn't really a big blast.)

      This is a 1950s idea.  Supposedly, splicing in a frame of ""Buy

Congress involved.  Talk of making it illegal.  General agreement by
networks not to do it.

      A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency
re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape
with single-frame messages.  It aired on a few stations, but a tech
at one station, previewing the tape, noticed a flicker and looked at
the tape frame-by-frame to find the ""defect"".  Big flap.  FCC notified.
Commercial pulled.  Press reports. Embarassed ad agency.  You could
probably find the press reports via Dialog or Nexis if you wanted.

      Now that everybody has VCRs, it's not likely that anybody could
get away with this on TV.

I have the same question for any tools for the 6502 derivative processor
the 65C816 processor (designed by Western Design Center).

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).

White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.

Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose
bandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20
kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). 

White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose
bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as ""1/3
octave"" or ""1/2 octave"" or some such terminology).

White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies
(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,
has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3
db/octave).

	Greetings. There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes:

	1) A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the
	   tape. The message usually reads, ""If seal is broken, you must
	   buy this tape""

	2) The standard ""MacroVision"" warning, ""Copies of this tape will

	3) [your case] Extended message for the Average Consumer (tm) which
	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the
	   original. I don't believe you can sue them for misinformation
	   in cases like this :-)

	Take care.

	P.S. Of course, #3 is utter BS - but the Average Consumer (tm)
	     believes it. Heck, my mom once returned such a tape without
	     watching it... she was afraid that something might just

For those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cable
leakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage that
is ""causing interference to other services"".

Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, and
measurement technique.  If you will clearly document your problem,
and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the
normal approach, remember to correct between measurement data and
microvolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong
Cable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letter
to the local cable company, you will get results.  In fact the cable
company will probably start treating you much better when they realize
you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention.

What is important is to document your case as it relates to the
applicable rules.  However the cable company *is required* to
at least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must file
with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement
report that details the results of leakage testing.

But remember, call the cable company first, and give them a
chance to work to correct the problem before contacting
the commission.

I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via
the airborne method.

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
refresh rates common.

So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were

No.  The blue LEDs sold down the street are in milky-white plastic.  

And, fyi, putting a filter on a ""typical visible light LED"" (presumably meaning
a non-blue one) won't produce blue light.  A filter can only block light, it
can't generate wavelengths that aren't there to start with.

I, some years ago, almost became a victim of this.  Squirted a fair amount in
an old model 15 Teletype which was acting up, then turned it on.  The eruption
when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... I almost got
my eyebrows singed, the plastic (old ones had safety glass) cover over the
platen, etc flew across the room, and several people in the room almost had
heart attacks.  Beware the explosive properties of WD40 vapor.

More than Talk:  From the FCC Rules:  73.4250 Subliminal Perception:

(a) See Public Notice, FCC 74-78, dated January 24, 1974, 44 FCC 2d, 1016; 39
Fr 3714, January 29, 1974.
(b) See FCC Information Bulletin, ""Subliminal Projection"" (sic, at least in my
rules service copy of the rules), dated November 1977.

Since I don't have either old copies of the Federal Register or the Information
Bulletin around, I can't tell you what you can't do on TV ( or radio) but I
seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late '70s. 

Practically speaking, I dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits
in MTV promos,  badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such, but
maby that's just because the contrast between the single frame and the
surrounding material was significant.  I never believed in the one-frame type
of SP being real.  

On the other hand, the Coca-Cola or Brand (insert desired name here) beer cans
conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched,
that's another story, and if your TV station or network was paid by the beer
company for the privilege of doing that, there has to be a ""Promotional
Consideration paid by ...) or similar message included with the program; but if
the TV station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company
and didn't get any of the payment for ""brand visibility"" that the film company
got, then they don't have to run the message.

With regards to what you wrote, how does one ""adjust for room dynamics 
and stuff like that""?  I asked a professor that question just
last week and he didn't really know himself.  Since pink noise is believed
to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's
a lack of a covalent bond) that act as ""traps"" to nearby elecrons, and since
this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't
able to ""trap"" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me
that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the
""pink noise"" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering
how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to
""man made noise"" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have
any information about this, it would be appreciated.  Hope this didn't sound
too drawn out.  Thanx.

Sorry Ian, I haven't toyed with it in several years. I haven't seen
the insides in quite a few years. I just saw the post lagging for
quite a few days, and thought I'd toss in my $0.02. I assume the 6507
was functionally similar to the 6502 (was it also made by MOS
Technologies?). I really am more versed in the (6502 based) Atari
computers. The 2600 came later on.

In the Atari computers, the ""CIA"" chip you refer to sounds an awful
lot like the CTIA (Color Television Interface Adapter) chip used in
the early models. Later Atari upgraded this to the GTIA (Graphics
...). Other colorful literature stated that the GTIA might have stood
for ""George,"" the developer of the chip.

Sorry, I am way out of line here. My first microcontroller I built was
a MC68701 based chipset with 128 bytes onboard. That was not easy to
work with (in addtion to a small 2K on-board EPROM).

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key, you can hack 
them by reading what happens. So I've been told, I've never seen this done 
but I think it's possible. You'd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port!

just does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle

will drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the

	Just thought I would add $0.02 to DeskJet thread. I got my
first one in college about 5 or so years ago.

	I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for
past 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I
got software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister
and father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go
for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).
The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would
say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one
(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.

	My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it
to him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief
advantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:

Advantages:	Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's
printing), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,
so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet
AppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one
DW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to
color or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I
received many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp
laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those
ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25
per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all
hours of the night....)

Disadvantages.	Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and
wasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink
(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and
running (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your
bookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts
(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to
$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but
I don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of
about 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after
fooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing
doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the
paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.
Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in
speed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press
software solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but
they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.

In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript
(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even
when soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only
instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board
Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser
Postscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB
negatives directly onto a transparency.

Well, hope my babbling has helped.

True, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or
so, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.  Making a bunch
of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure
things won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at least
defeats your approach.  It's a little costly, though.

Personally, I don't believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought
that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs
the gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program.

Mike, Ring is the RED wire. Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard
phone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used for
voice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermost
connectors of an RJ-11 phone jack.

Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to
GREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the
voltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position).
I am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone too
much if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get
grounded to earth ground elsewhere).

Additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts
DC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current
loop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potential
of about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get the
electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).

Hope that clears things...

If you want slow LED flash rates, adjustable by switches (or by a
4066/4016 digitally controlled switch), I suggest looking at a 555
oscillator chip. They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in
quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info
about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest
Mims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with
resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math
to get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a
555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate
doing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz
to about 500 KHz (I think).

About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to
use one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio
line (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.

The data line is probably most easily done
by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565
chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing
about how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp
information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack
info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.
Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I
would suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is
going into, so I am really generalizing...

As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I
suggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would
be the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.
Hope that clears things......

The lead-acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following
chemical reaction:
 
Pb + PbO2 + 2H2SO4 --> 2PbSO4 + 2H20
 
Lead and Lead (IV) Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water
 
The standard heats of formation at 25 C (77 F) of the various compounds are:
 
              Heat of formation
Compound      at 25 C, kcal/mole
--------      ------------------
   Pb               0.00
  PbO2            -65.0
 H2SO4           -193.69
 PbSO4           -218.5
  H20             -68.3174
 
The heat of reaction at 25 C is therefore -60.6 kcal per mole PbSO4 produced.
Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water
at 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (I am almost
sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be
wrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel
like thinking through it right now.)
 
What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,
is exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes
(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals
may form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.
The reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery
charger) is put back into the battery.
 
Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each
cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts
(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric
energy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it
has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So
while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.
 
To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on
concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's
Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will
act to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities
of a some selected materials:
 
                                              thermal conductivity
       material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)
       --------           ------------------  --------------------
diatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051
 natural, across strata        871                   0.077
diatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081
 parallel to strata            871                   0.106
diatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039
  (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042
                              (300)                  0.044
                              (400)                  0.048
                              (500)                  0.051
concrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20
         (stone)               ---                   0.54
         (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44
pine (across grain)             15                   0.087
   (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20
oak (across grain)              15                   0.12
maple (across grain)            50                   0.11
 
Note that the thermal conductivity for ""dirt"" (diatomaceous earth) goes down
with temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder
are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity
of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4
times greater than wood.
 
It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on
concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the
discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity
or heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)
During storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on
the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity
surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity
surface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom
surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,
the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster
than that on dirt.
 
This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from
the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the
reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that
temperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is
a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner
of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which
""pulls"" the reaction along.
 
Also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric
acid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.

Two things to watch for:
In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed ""down"" by one position; this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.
OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course
illegal.

Most (if not virtually all) swedish exchanges can handle tone

This is just basicly right. The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger
town, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.
And regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that does
just apply to pulsdialing. Not to touchtone.
Btw; Norway is even more interesting. They got both system! So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live.

(Almost right for pulsdialing.)
Some phones have a little switch inside, so you are able to use them
all over Norway, or you can just renumber the numbers on your phone.

Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want. The MAX7219 drives 8
7 segment LED displays with full decode or drives 64 discrete LED's with
a 3 wire serial interface.  The chips can also be cascaded to allow very
large arrays.  I am working on a sign display using this part.

I'll have to post the contact info for Maxim later, it's at home.  There was
a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of Circuit Cellar Ink's.

I'll toss in my 2 cents worth - I've begun to think that distribution
disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available.
We've been especially plagued by Borland's distribution disks.  I'm 
lucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap 
out on me.  So definitely, as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies
to do our installations with.

	Actually, no I don't have a tape drive.  In the event of a total
hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data
from the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard
disk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape
drive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!

	Maybe, maybe not.  Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),
but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS
information is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS
manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the
motherboard.  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk
backup/restore.

	As long as it wasn't done too terribly often.  Otherwise I think it

	Of course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be
reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is ""this
software has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to
install it on other machines.""  Or something similar; Access for Windows
does this and it only requires a click on ""OK"" to go away.  Pretty
non-intrusive, but it gets the point across.

	This is a great idea.  I like the key system that some shareware
products use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big
software companies to implement this without it getting very
cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.

	Being in the ""visualization"" stage of a circuit design right now,
I was wondering what the best way to ""scale"" an AC voltage using an 8-bit
digital word is. I am thinking of using the common method of sending the
word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage (converted
to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. However, I am leary of this
method because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b)
creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. I
realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference,
but that would require more parts and boost the price further.
	Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8
bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip.
Unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer;
if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me.
	I am building this project as a ""dimmer box"" for a light
controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains
very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user
wishes to control (well, each channel, at least). Therefor, if each box
costs $150, I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 =
$2400) for sixteen channels... This is something I have noticed about
today's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive!
	Anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of
easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always
the preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!

What frequency is your carrier?

Have you considered using two tones, one for 1 and another for 0?

How high is your RS-232 data rate?

Can you use more than one carrier freq?

Have you considered hiring an RF data transmission consultant?

Why can't he record it legally?  It may not be admissable in court, but
recording for personal use is legal.  If he wants to play it for his ham
friend, that's legal too, as long as he doesn't charge admission.

It doesn't actually have to be 1500 watts at 100 feet.  I've heard radio
transmissions from concert security over guitar amps with no guitar plugged
in, and security uses radios transmitting 2-5 watts into a rubber duck antenna,
which acts more like a dummy load than an antenna.

Hi all,

I am looking for a new oscilloscope (BK 1541-B, it looks like, Goldstar OS904S
if I can find one cheap enough) and would like suggestions on a low-priced
source for them.

(Currently, BTW, Fry's electronics in Los Angeles has the 1541-B for $598,
 the best price I've seen overall for now - They carry the GS OS902S for 
 $490, but I need the 904S because of the 40 MHz B/W)

Thanks all.

What, pray tell, are you putting together?  And what about costs?  And does it

For the most part, silver-solder is not used for general soldering
tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth. Silver-solder, when
exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field, will actually
grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically
short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field. For this 
reason, silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies.
Fortunatly, tin-lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites
as fast as silver-solder. Therefore, it is used extensively.

Subject: Re: Laser vs Bubblejet?
Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine
Lines: 90

There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers
available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and
possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with
rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right
side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a
gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow
your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information
packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a
coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new
capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find
that the cartidges now last longer.

I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your
nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.

HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical
components that vary depending on the starting level printer and
the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original
desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are
likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new
deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an
original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no
soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping
the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP
service center for further information.

The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from
the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser
printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a
raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material
difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the
accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously
slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are
still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect
works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works
efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.

The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that
permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one
megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as
about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for
its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded
printing that allows incrmental download of the image with
compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable
fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.

A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This
is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet
printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer
has completed its warm-up cyle.

Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image
deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but
matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.
Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the
problem.

Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable
components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,
mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste
could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing
stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the
laserjet IV.

Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous
silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image
drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice
print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has
a neat modular paper source and stacker system.

The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower
than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are
subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The
usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.
The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a
single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is
almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,
though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.
I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.

It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If
you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the
appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,
the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.

If your looking for LEDs in the $.10-$.20 range, forget it. Blue LEDs just
recently became available and the materials they are made of are expensive.
Maybe in the future they will become less expensive (and brighter), but
for now it's going to cost you and the output will be limited. If they ever
do get as efficient and cost effective as red and green LEDs, you're probably
going to see a whole new family of color displays.

If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder, the ideal comunications
would be over a multi-drop system, like RS-485.  RS-485 boards are available
for PC's, probably cheaper than a bunch of RS-232 channels, and RS-485 is
cheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply
8-pin DIP driver chip.  Software at the PC end would be similarly complex
for either RS-232 or RS-485, in my opinion.  The higher data rates possible
with RS-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.
Hope this helps.

What are people's opinions about laser detectors?  Escort makes a
laser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However,
I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
detector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travels
in all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?

Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buy
their wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'll
save $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition of
the laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport
1000 normally costs $100).

The green layer is a solder-mask, and is used to make a finished board
look neat, and to avoid solder bridges, especially when using wave
soldering (or any other mechanized approach). I've seen red mask,
but most that I've seen are green.

A bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask
is put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side
(or just one side) of the board.
A fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green
solder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass
board with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.
Teflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.

I'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're
not about to change. Also, any change in any chemical probably requires
a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards. A lot
of companies do not make their own boards... they ship them to a real
boardhouse.

The 9144w4 is the date code but none of my books list a W03563.

In the odd case that 9144w4 is not the date code, NTE says a 9144-60

Check the station's master sync generator.  You'll probably find that
it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't
being used.  A couple of cables and you're in business.

Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD
outputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to the
cameras.

If neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync
separator.  Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators -
they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.

I am looking for a text/reference that will include pinouts, 
description, and functionality for just about any IC made.
Does such a text exist?  Are there docs on the Internet that
reference IC's?  It would be a great idea if each major
IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
FTP site with all it's data books in the form of text files.
(ala RFC style).  This would save time and money for the
IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
IC's
are found in the internet anyway.  

Are there any books available for purchase that reference
(as many as possible)?  Or am I going to be stuck obtaining
a zillion databooks from the manufacturers (those little
phonebook-type books that are obsoleted every couple years)

Yes it has to be very clear (like it wasn't there).  And of course, cost is 
always a factor.  I am trying to get an idea of the feasability of such an

WHAT??!!!!

You can't remove it, unless you register?  
You gotta be joking, right?
What happens if I get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then
decide that I don't like it.  Do I have to register to be able to get rid
of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!)
If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a
statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!


A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow
anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some
additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed
to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program.
Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever
time they like.

Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That
could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a
specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.


As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions:
Limit the size of data that the program can work with,
Disable saving the data,
Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as
such)
Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started
and/or exited

etc....
but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.

Hey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers?  Just
a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues

occasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM scheme
or something.  Thanx in advanced.

---------->
The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.

Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like
switching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called ""class S""
before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable
for very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile
amp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year
(to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems
with layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-able
isolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) 

I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that
operates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver
amps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit 
(I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and
I beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that
it had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on
PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)
under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high
current at the zero-voltage crossings).

Ah-ha!  I'm not alone at last!  Which Sony do you have??  I have a
27""SXR (pre-XBR series, circa 1987).  That damn thing used to
make noise like a mad-man.  I had/have 2 separate problems...one being the
flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke
came together. 

First:  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly,
the thing would make noise.  I guess that there was enough of a potential
in that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation
spray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic.  That fixed it.

Second:  Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one.  If I
leave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on,
and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the
cover on!! :-(

A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole
leak somewhere on the flyback.  Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of
black dust/dirt.

I hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!

I am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular American phone
on your home system. I vaguely remember a few years ago, when ""Deutsche
Bundespost"" split into Postdienst, Postbank, and Telekom there was some
discussion about a new regulation. I know that cordless or cellular phones
still have to be approved by the Telekom, but does that hold true for regular
phones? In my areacode in Germany (2234 - Frechen, near Koeln) you can use
touch-tone dialing. I assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively
set to pulse dialing. Last time I checked (Jan '93) the Cologne areacode 221
was still solely pulse dialing.

BTW, touch tone does become more common in Germany, bringin with it the
flourishing of 1-900 services (in Germany 0190). I just hope we'll all have
ISDN some time at an affordable price - idle wishes...

Why are circuit boards green?  The material used to make them goes by two
names.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The same
material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a
structural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They
are not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are
a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on
the resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National
Electronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer
of epoxy resins) to find out.  As an aside, I occasionally mix clear epoxy
and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.
The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10.  They are
the same green color.

We use a CD-ROM based system here.  There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a
4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned
images of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for
something it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.
THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.
It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand
the data base to handle more types of stuff.

These systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get
monthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to
them so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a
yearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.

If you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a
page-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can
also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page
printing takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump
the 5 or 6 pages you usually need.

I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available
to all Internet users.    :-)

The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution.
PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4
is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of
PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.

>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,
>is exothermic, or energy discharging.

As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).
(More about this later.)

What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:
(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)
The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things
happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead
           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).
        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution
           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).
Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate
in a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)
we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4
forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this
happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).

The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If
there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate
(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.

I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they
are for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore
the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with
these products for a newer battery.

In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher
temperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:
""If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to
 -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.""  We all know from experience (at
 least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is
not true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm
the battery.

(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge
 to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any
 such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This
 is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool
 during storage.)

Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!

has a page feature where you can make the phone or hand set ring to get

with the phone in the garage? (ie push a button to make the phone ring in the

	Typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap
FIR, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit.  At this kind
of speed (slow, by digital standards) such an adder is much less
expensive than analog components of comparable precision.

	I gleaned this information from a hardware manual for
an old CD player design; where one would find similar info for
a particular CD (the digital filter IS an interesting component,
from my point of view), I have no idea.  The digital filter
is a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical 
analysis, to see just how BROAD the term 'interpolation' is...),

I would be interested in knowing more about the sensing hardware.  What did

Hello there.  The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought
about constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  I figured on
substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the
antenna coil, etc., myself.

The only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning
capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which
used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to
be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer
capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this
application.

So, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 
0--360 pF range?

Manythanks.

Rubbish. The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used
a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a ""dry film"" mask applied to them (usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red
or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner. There's a lot of info
about the pro's and con's of each, but that's another story...

        Yes, it is possible.  I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, 
with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.
   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is 
bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip 
numbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, 
which will do you NO good for reading in.
  
          Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:
  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.
  In pascal, you would ""Write(Port[xxx]);"" where xxx is the address in 
either hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the 
strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, 
so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output 
to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, 
do ""Port[xxx]:=value
"".
 
                Hope this helps.
        Let me know if you need more help.

Oh dear, time for me to try to remember my chemistry.  Let's see if I
can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind.
<sounds of gears>  <fumes of overheated oil>  <unmistakable stench of
the Nasal Chromatograph>   Ha!  I knew there was a double bond!  Now
how shall I show that in ASCII? 

          MEK:                                 Acetone:

          C - C - C - C                        C - C - C
              #                                    #
              O                                    O

The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond.  MEK has a
methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone
has two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead
is dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think
that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.
It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.  Use acetone.

Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.  If you buy
some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more
expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need.

Acetone will likely damage the carpet. First solvent to try is denatured
alcohol. Do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol. You can use methyl
alcohol instead of denatured alcohol. If you want to have a cocktail while
you are removing the goo, use pure grain alcohol :-). If the alcohol does
not work try carbon tetrachloride. If neither of these work you may need to
try a stronger solvent, but the alcohol works for most adhesives. Good luck.

  Well, Bertil, you might laugh, but in many places here in Austria, there are
no wall jacks yet, either - just wires sticking out of the wall (and put into
a closed, often sealed, box) :-)
  As far as I remember from Germany, it is a nicely mixed situation - somebody
had wires sticking, somebody had jacks...
  On the other hand, everywhere in Bohemia I have seen wall jacks, and never
seen just wires sticking out of the wall... And I thought Slovakia was the
same case. Well...

   This is called silver bearing solder.   It is used to solder to
devices that have silvered contacts.   One application is soldering
to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These
were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.
If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver
off of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated
solution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be
disolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts
are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.

I know of at least one ftp-site from which you can download the cracks of
about any commercial game in existence. The names of the companies (yes,
companies!) are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes. According to
them, it is not illegal (at least in the USA, according to a statute or 
something) to remove the copy protection from any program. The only condition
is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own
convenience.

If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such 
company. I will not give the name of this ftp-site to anyone, even if only
to protect the companies which wrote the original games.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone the use or cracking of any programs. I believe 
it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run.

On the subject of copy protection: Most pirates don't give a damn about 
using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting 
the program. They just don't have a conscience.

Yes and no. I would use the FM transmitter chip from Motorola (Linear and  
Interface Databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. SBL-1 from  
mini circuits lab). Everything is done in the FM chip and then mixed up with  
the oscillator frequency. Just have a look at the ARRL Handbook. There are lots  
of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. I don't think, there are single  
chip designs for such high frequencies yet.

Yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although I would handle
it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice.  The chemical is called
d-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extract
of some kind).  You might find it in a hardware store, sold as a
general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store --
it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.  It works on sticker glue, crayons,
grease, oil, etc.

It's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add
water, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.

Gee, how about an (ahem) ""accelerometer""! Such devices are available from
a variety of sources (one that comes to mind is Bruel & Kjaer if you have
a lot of money to spend). MOst of these sorts of devices output a voltage
proportional to acceleration. You need to know what range you're talking
about though.

The 200CD is one of three oscillators that HP made many years ago. 
(The others were the Low Frequency Oscillator and the Wide Range

a Wein Bridge circuit that used pilot lights as the feedback loop,
and firebottles that produced many volts of output.

I've just acquired a pair of these venerable old beasts. 
The non-working one, SN 605, (owned by Crosley Radio at one point!)
needs help. I know I can likely buy a microfiche copy of the book

the pair in the rain at the Dayton Hamvention;-}

>Rubbish. The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder

The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without
any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box
labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one
in the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some 
fiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason
for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).

I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd
bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind 
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (Q dope
for coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with
minimal loss).

The curiosities that you speak of are EL (Electro-Luminescent) pads.  They
are mostly used as backlights for LCD's, and as you pointed out, comes
in several different colors.  Many of them emit white-ish colors (""true""
white, and blue-whiteis-blue are the ones that I've personally encountered
the most often.)

They vary in their input requirements, however, they tend to operate at 
about 100 Vrms, and at much higher than 60 Hz.  (400 Hz to 1 kHz, if I 
recall correctly.)   You can get them to work at 120 Vrms, 60 Hz (i.e.,
line) but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster.
(Oh yes, almost forgot, EL's have this tendency to wear out over time...)

I remember, back before commercial mikes with the ""PZM"" label (for
Pressure Zone Microphone) started showing up, I read an article,
in some engineering journal, that described the principles involved.
All the physics aside, from a practicle standpoint the author's said
they built a prototype with nothing more than a small Sony lavelier
mike laid up against a large aluminum disk.  In demonstrating it at
a presentation to audio engineers, this was impressive enough that
the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them.

Anyway...I want to build some to use as ""choir mikes"" (wide coverage).
I've had good luck using some small electret mike elements I got
from Digi-Key - most of these are limited-bandwidth, peakey units
but for a buck or two more I got the ones spec'd to go out to 20kHz
with a bit flatter response.  

The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of
critical.  I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, which
puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mounting
it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a
small clearance.  I haven't dissected a unit like you can buy at
Radio Shack to see how they do it.  Thoughts?

I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered
for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode.

Also, I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following
about the Monochrome Display & Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer
Adapter:

    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these
    lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.

And later:

    If an external device should be driving data on these pins (in
    violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this
    data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.

I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
as a result of my saying, ``I DO NOT know for sure, but I think
you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the
data lines, while an external device drives them.''  The input
data will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.

Sorry Geoff,

Agree solder mask is green, but in the old days we didn't have wave soldering
machines (which are another topic again).  I had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning!

Board under the mask was the original query.

BTW cheap inport electronic devices (mainly from 3rd world countries) are done
with brown pheonolic boards.  Is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools.  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home.  They are very obviously hand soldered.  Quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into Canada from Red China.  In China there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours.  One of my
co-workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost 50%.

Also, the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press.  An old lithographer friend had a press for this.  After the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors.

For some time I've been thinking about the possiblity of starting a group
where scientific articles can be published (or perhaps just summaries).
Possible advantages would be:
* Free disribution
* Fast acceptance
* Online discussion between authers and readers

This would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the
articles and one perhaps without for discussion.

The best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which
would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready. Perhaps
Postscript or Rich Text Format?

But how do you start a new group? Anyone interrested?

You don't say what kind of ""electronic equipment"" you mean.  It's hard
to give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that won't
do things like washing lubricant out of switches.

When we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just
used distilled water.  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear
is *completely* dry before powering it up again.  We let it dry for
several days to be damn sure.

I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water.  I would
be very wary of CCl4, not least because it is dangerous to *you* even
if it's not going to harm the equipment -- not only is it poisonous,
but I believe it's now known to be carcinogenic.

Accelerometers are not cheap, mainly because the outputs are fairly linear 
with respect to acceleration.  You don't say what the range of acceleration 
you want to measure is, and there are other ways in which to measure it 
other than using an accelerometer.  Additional information would be helpful

       It's possible to make boards in other colors, and I have an ad
for laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your
choice of Day-Glo (tm) colors.

       The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas.
The dark green or blue is the solder mask layer, and I suspect that color
is a dye.

Don't mount it on the side.  Call up Crown, the company that has the
patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.

Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather
short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.

Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap
Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a
clean balanced output.  Phil's mods seem to get reposted here on a regular
basis.

They are real, and we still pay licence fees to receive TV.
The detector vans pick up the IF, true. This tells them what channel you
are watching. The can also pick up the line time base freq, and frame rate
(Try it with a LW/MW radio near telly, it picks up a sharp hum)

From this they can even watch (poor quality though) what *you* have on the
screen, by picking up re radiating junk.

Does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data I/O (print spooler,
digital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a DMA chip or a
dedicated microcontroller?  Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best
way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a
memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use
by the smart data I/O.
 
Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  Fast, cheap, and easy
to obtain would be nice, but I won't limit my choices to only those that fit
those characteristics.  Even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what I want,
but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with
onchip (E)EPROM.
 
So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simple
to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a
few I/O lines.

I am not sure about this, but I believe that Analog Devices in Norwood,
MA makes a relatively inexpensive acceleration sensor (primarily for
use in auto air-bag systems). I do not know specs or anything else, but
you might give them a call to find out more info.

feedback to base                  
to control operating point (I expect this really hurts Noise Figure! Any
comments from Phototransistor experts?)

We intended to use this atop a stepper motor, to provide headings to the
beacons. The plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons, of different frequencies, in 
each room, and tell the 567 what frequency to phase-lock to. We did not do so.
One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps!
Knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor 
technique of RESECTION to determine robot location. (No, I ain't going to
explain resection over the net.)

Given hindsight, I would digitize the amplified output of the self-nulling
phototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves at
the several expected frequencies, to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon.
By doing this at the numerous steps, even with  8 degree steps, with knowledge
of the angular response of the phototransistor, you SHOULD be able to
rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.

   Two things to watch for:
   In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
   of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
   phone can be set to pulse dialing.
   In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
   are pushed ""down"" by one position; this makes dialing (and
   in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
   Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
   phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.
   OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course
   illegal.

As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecom
operators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.

I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMF
dialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have
been retrofitted with ""magic fingers"" that converts from DTMF to pulse
dialing.

Yes, it does.
All the equipment has to have that Telekom approval number to be
legal.
What has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else.
I'm pretty sure the same holds true in Sweden (at least when I read
some information on it about tweo years ago).
And BTW I do know that most of the lines in Sweden can handle tone-dialing,
just don't be sure that all can.

I've been wondering about this myself.  The house wiring thing is really

be that much selectivity in frequencies?  Have there been ANY studies

various life forms?

And how effective could they be?  I certainly would not want to tell anyone

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources aren't driving directly into each other. 

Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing
high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,
etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing
line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.

Might depend on where you live .. I know locally, for most of the winter
the ground, and concrete floor, within sheds and garages (unheated) is
signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature.  The air does get
warmer during the day, but during the night, the ground and concrete
is definitely warmer, especially when protected by the walls from the
albedo effect.  And the nights are longer by several hours than the
days.

   How much software is out there for the Mac?  I've been interested

   I would like to use a 6811 or 6816.  I'm proficient in 6800 assembly,
but have never NEEDED it except some toying with old 6802EVBs.

   Motorola doesn't seem to have any information on Mac software (at
least their local distributor doesn't) and the ELE department around
here has been of little help as well.
   I hope someone can tell me that I don't have to buy an IBM to 
work with the 6811 or 6816 Evaluation Boards...please send me mail!

Bzzzzzt! Wrong answer.  The UK tone dialling is identical to the US system. 
The different settings on your modem are so that it uses CCITT V21 & V22 
tones for data transmission, rather than Bell 103 & Bell 121 tones, which are 
used only in the USA and canada AFAIK.  As most people now use at least 
V22bis, this is largely irrelevant.

I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke-87 multimeter
suggests applying WD-40 to the test lead sockets, especially the
current range socket.  The intention is to prevent the
test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there
is no test lead in that socket.

The manual is a bit vague, but I think I'd apply the WD-40 to a
swab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly
from the can.

Speaking of said meters:  I compared the 87 against the 8060A that
I've had on my bench for almost 11 years.  It has been five years
since the 8060A has been calibrated.  On the DC scale, they agree
within .01 mV.  AC scale is within about .1 mV.  The 87 would be
just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; I
didn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since I
don't use dB all that much in my work.

Nope.  Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the
long cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I
would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short
peaks.

You can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try
strapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,
which will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're
going to need a bigger generator.

I assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the
voltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming out
of the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.

I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of
work, and not with the pro-audio people.  Also, I recommend that you don't
try to tap into junction boxes at all, but hire a licensed electrician if
you don't really know what you are doing.  I've had to clean up after two
people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot 200A boxes, and it wasn't

Open up one of the airbag control boxes.  They have inexpensive piezoelectric

- it has given up listening to the remote.  (i tried changing the remote's

i've never seen that before ...)

- before all the strangeness started, the system turned itself OFF and ON

- sometimes it won't play a radio station, so i have to kinda twist it

it is inconvenient, but NOT inconvenient enough to pay an

If you use MEK for your sake wear safty glasses or better still
industrial goggles. The small est drop in the eye will casue

The results are similar to mustard gas contamination. Note MEK peroxide

I think its a great, but idealistic idea. A reseacher will first of all try 
to publish a worthy paper in a credible, professional magazine and not in a 
community like USENET which is infamous for lots (not all) of junk 
information. The papers that will be ""published"" here will, in general, be 
of low quality. Also, it is improbable that any credit will be given to a 
researcher who publish here - and sadly, that is nowadays a main reason for 
publishing.

USENET is great for informal discussions and free exchange of ideas - keep 
it like that. A new, specialist group is just not worth it.

Solder mask is available in a variety of colors too.  Depending on
the supplier, the color helps indentify the material.

Don't forget conformal coating.

I don't think I've seen phenolic impregnated paper boards in
anything other than the familar brown, but it would not be
difficult to add a dye to change the color.

Laser holes are (or were) used to prevent someone from making exact copies 
of a disk. You do not want to write to the damaged disk, only read and use 
the programs.

I remember a program called Copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser 
hole in it. I think it simulates the laser hole. After copying the disk the 
program is, if necessary, used in conjunction with a program called Nokey or 
something. (The program tells you which program to use)

No solution.

Sorry, my news reader doesn't want to reply.

1) Ling, S.C. ""Fluxgate magetometer for Space Application"", IEEE Journal 
Spacecraft, Vol. 1, No. 2, March-April 1964, pp 175-180.

Oldish, but usable. Background information

2) ""Fluxgate magnetometry"", Electronics world + Wireless world, September 
1991, pp. 726-732.

Great! Circuit diagrams etc for building an electronuc compass

Sorry about following up my own article, but I wanted to continue
that what might be being missed here is that the important thing
might not be temperature differences per se, but the action of
heat sinking the battery.

Perhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical
lead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting
one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  This
would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries
at the same ambient temperature.

I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the
one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have
some validity.
