I don't like the term ""quack"" being applied to a licensed physician David.
Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).
I'll give you some examples.

	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no 
	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.

	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid 
	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.

	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has 
	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by 
	   the NCI.

These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should 
not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of 
which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal 
agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be 
having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of 
commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to 
relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,
others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a 
chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the 
healer's oath, ""I will do no harm"".  But you know David that very few 
treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a 
very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each 
physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some 
are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive 
approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long 
as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake 
in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in 
the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as 
quacks or even unethical.

What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  
These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the 
frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are 
really doing a pretty good job of providing ""alternative"" medicine.  But 
many lack any formal training and are in the ""business"" simply to make a 
few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting 
competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative 
care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find 
someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of 
money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-
medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the 
liscened physicians).

I hope that this clears things up David.

I am writing this to find out the following:

1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.

2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.

3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.

My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with 
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he 
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, 
Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  
These treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told 
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen 
wrap and a ""Hill Repair"".  He opted for the ""Hill Repair"". He recovered 
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).

The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition 
which he called ""Barrett's Syndrome"". If he can't avoid having reflux will 
he necessarily get cancer?

Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd 
appreciate it.

Thanks,

For one week, she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. If it
changes anything. 

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you
had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave
cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's
hard to digest anyway. 

For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal ""last"" longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the
baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How
tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses 
your middle. Be sure not to ""suck in"" your stomach when sitting, again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract. 

Try laying on your sides, back,
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.
Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby
""turn"" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.
When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my
second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he
didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.


Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. 
But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible. 

Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My
first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.
Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) 

Good luck

Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who
treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. 
There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. 

There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories
and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists. 

Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.  

Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
quacks in Babylon. 

Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses
aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue
against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month
or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. 

Sometimes a correct diagnosis
takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the
disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have
something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been
described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,
sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,
sometimes they find it's incurable.  

There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an 
illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is
more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.

Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a ""licensed
physician"" being called a quack?  Or is it just that being a licensed
physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the
physician agrees with your system of beliefs?

>Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.

Actually, I almost never use the term quack.  When I discuss
""systemic yeast syndrome"", however, I always point out that
mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree
with that characterization).

>Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word

Really?  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what
Steve Dyer, Gordon Banks, and I am implying when we have talked about
systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis.  Would you prefer the
word ""charlatan""?  (I don't happen to think that all quacks are
charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the ""diseases"" they
are diagnosing.)

existence of systemic yeast syndrome?

 As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
and is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just as
capable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are ""qualified"" to
read x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing
else, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this time
spent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of
practice). If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by
this technique.

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist.
No scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out
the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't
find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---
namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,
many of them appear to get better.  

So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,
controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any
better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject
disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do
controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's
completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that
doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some
other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be
true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people
have been talking about.

But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal
evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some
candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind
study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. So there is one
book out there..at least one :).

There were several types of eye dominance. Where a person looks in their
memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to
coordination activities like hitting a ball. Another for reading. 

I didn't read one that discussed prescription strength. Although people
with bad vision, near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
eye.

	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's

	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for
hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it. 

	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the
hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).

I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . 

I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.

I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel

Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL
 
    By Laura Pitter
    TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist
when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim
town of Srebrenica last August.
    But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody
war, he considers himself a surgeon.
    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no
license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives
normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''
    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,
the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of
the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the
suffering of the thousands trapped there.
    ``I lived through hell together with the people of
Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest
heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.
    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant
at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he
had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says
he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for
guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without
anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean
sections.
    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the
first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000
patients.
    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from
Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people
carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him
through guerrilla terrain, he said.
    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells
landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football
field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of
the dead were women and children.
    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the
children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the
blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.
    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not
piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her
hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no
heads.''
    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were
deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had
the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.
    The six general practitioners who had been operating before
he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They
didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''
    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by
mid-September he had run out of supplies.
    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes
they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no
anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain
because it increased bleeding.
    ``People were completely conscious during amputations and
stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were
impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.
    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.
    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived
from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.
    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in
mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the
region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''
    Then the hunger set in.
    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began
air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day
from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.
    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the
people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.
    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in
Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.
    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after
visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.
    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of
people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when
I left. And I cried too.''

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The
doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the
one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest
route, and so I am happy with it.

Funny, I thought it meant ""one who fraudulently misrepresents his

27th).  Certainly more precision than conveyed by ""chronic yeast"".

The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous
representations is far more frightening.  It is fraud to promote a
treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it
and the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner
doesn't know so.  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks
incompetency.

>(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on

May I reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of
non-scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts
of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out, they should
learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing
hierarchy and divisions.

Secaris is reasonably inexpensive ($6.00 Cdn for a tube), and is indeed an
over the counter medication. Why it does not appear to be available in the
US, I don't know. It's manufactured in Montreal.

It's a nasal lubricant, and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from
dry mucous membranes.

From some of the replies to my original posting, it's evident that some
people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
from environmental influences (ie, dry air). But I've had no responses
from anyone with experience with Rutin. Is there another newsgroup that

In the kind I have made I used a Lite sour cream instead of yogurt.  May not

The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence
of this ""syndrome"".  To date, these claims are unsubstantiated
by any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would
take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based
upon their data.

Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about
myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of
medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for
basing therapy than ""Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ..."".

Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis,
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike
mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.

Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable
ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain.

One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after
having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old).
Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans.

She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered
in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is
in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe
the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked
until four years ago).

Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different
from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right
below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are
the chances for full remission/recovery?

Thanks.

Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really
started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in
there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE

I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY
different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.

UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my
Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.

> PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up, I am just

Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY
time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.
And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)
- it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own
personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST
IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof
that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw
out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -
and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple
explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so
I can either throw it out or give it away.)

> From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee)

Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.  

I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I
have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once
a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will
bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of
the Chinese restaurants the day before.

But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -
some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many
people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I
KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.
Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that
most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at
different times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the
reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but
for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ
chips ;}).

Cathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it
""chinese restaurant syndrome"" and I NEVER stated I got it only from
Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my
personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or
not hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them
to make me ONE back of chips without MSG.

Last year, I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia.  I couldn't remember doing anything that would have
caused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do,
and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became more
painful and I had the repair operation.

This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to be
another inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday for
another fun 8-) operation.

I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38
years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start falling
apart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear
when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger?

Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting
anything?  It's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack
full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days.  Is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk?

Of course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at
the computer, reading news...

""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""

By Mike Royko
Tribune Media Services


     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.
     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
Families USA.
      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe 
that doctors make too much money.
     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be 
OK.
     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.
     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment 
and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
and are still simmering.
     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority 
of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who 
do are stealing it from them.
     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  
Karl Marx lives.
     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such 
as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
become a physician?
     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should 
have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they 
should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much 
a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
doctor?
     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How 
much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent 
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and 
maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years 
of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth 
years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and 
(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) 
put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, 
depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in 
debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 
hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or 
more until they retire or fall over?""
     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably 
more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and 
Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
called together to remake America's health care.
     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far 
more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, 
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.
     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, 
many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
major cause of high medical costs.
     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  
Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for 
our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in 
a McDonald's?
     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch 
cabbages.
     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or 
Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But 
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, 
they might have been more honest if they had said:
     ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, 
you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you 
guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; 
getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
     ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single 
biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is 
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
     ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
your blubbery bods all day.
     ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and 
start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-
greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""
     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, 
there is another solution: Don't use them.
     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those 
spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands 
upon your head and declare you fit.
     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest 
pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit 
there, and pop in a couple of valves.
     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that 
overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?
     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  
And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on 
how to give it its shots.
     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
pollsters should earn?

Julie, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or
something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic
to it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and
like their taste, yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them
(regularly). MSG might have other bad (or good, I am not up on

reason enough not to use it. 

Altho' your example of the ulcer is funny, it isn't an

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does 
short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after
the use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the
drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part
catalysts for this.  Any comments?

Looking in The Evolution of Anaesthesia by M.H. Armstrong Davison
(pub Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore 1965) I found the following
chronology:

""1853.  Charles-Gabriel Pravaz (1791-1853), inventor of the
galvanocautery, describes a glass syringe with tapered nozzle. This
syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting
ferric chloride into aneurysms, and thus to heal them by coagulation.

1853.  Alexander Wood (1817-84)  of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic
needle and adapts Pravaz's syringe for use with it.""

You might also be interested to read about the experiments of Sir
Christopher Wren in 1656, described by Oldenberg & Clarck in the
Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society in 1665. Using a
sharpened quill and a pig's bladder he injected opium, wine and beer

You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual
drops instead of shots for treatment. (You are given a small bottle of
antigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) My
allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatment
process I had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing
and a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralized
a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual
drops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost is
less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.

First, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go
through this.  I know it has to have been tough.

There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly
adults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents
can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of
the body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions between
medications can cause confusion.

As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after
the drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anything
to that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information.
I can see what I can find...

I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to
the Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is ""Especially useful for agitation
associated with senile dementia""  (p. 400).  It also should not be 
discontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lasting
effects.

Because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know
what else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able
to answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information,
I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have
happened.

The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital
but I can answer a few general points.

Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after
being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment
will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even
young people find the change unsettling.

Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -
anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the
elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the
change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have
tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the
patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of
the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these
patients early.

Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)
generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to
the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full
mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is
the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult

Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life
of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow
release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are
sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing
more it is hard to comment.

I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were
definitely involved. 

My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate
medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling
us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if
he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With
the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication
discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.
Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many
medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.

I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is an
aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believe
that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to
take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reduces
the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care
providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those
circumstances. 

I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggest
you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss
it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.

Just my opinion,

While I don't have an answer for you, I reckon Blaise Pascal is generally
credited with inventing the syringe per se.  I don't know much about the
needles; however, I do know of a southwest Virginia country doctor who
some thrity or more years ago invented, patented, used, and sold a syringe/
hypodermic needle combination that retracted, injected with the flip of a
trigger, then retracted, giving a near-painless injection.  The fellow was
Dr. Daniel Gabriel, and it was termed the Gabriel--somebody else syringe.

No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs 
potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects
all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and 
antihistamines!)

>...he was disoriened [the doctors thougt ] they should put him on something
>else as well!

Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes
the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.
This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home!!!!

I fully agree.  In addition, she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.
I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician
is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone 
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, 
or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.
By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.

 I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,
 so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.
 
 Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should
 generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid 
 complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)
 you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other
 major component of the bioflavonoid complex.
 I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it
 showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-
 fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in 
 hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids 
 to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.
 Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so
 there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole
 bioflavonoid complex instead.

 I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that 
 they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose 
 bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...
 One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day
 for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.
  
 They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can
 be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are
 made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.

 About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, 
 with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.
 For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.
 
 In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they
 are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine 
 bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
 small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times
 higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark
 extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.
 The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'
  
   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:
 
   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable
   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing 
   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable 

   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing
 
   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg.  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur: intercourse.  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of
""natural"" acts here.  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina (i.e. coitus interruptus), but that's
about at far as you can get.  Through clothes -- no way.  Better go talk
to your biology teacher.

 Speaking from experience, one doesn't need drugs to become disoriented
during hospital stays. I was in hosp for 5 days in late Jan; what with
general noise at all hours of night, staff coming every time I turned over,
or whatever, to check me out, I didn't get much sustained sleep at night.

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of
fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles
exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching
arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise
also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally
distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to ""spot reduce"" body fat
other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is
genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like ""fat"",
so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the ""fat""
is ""changing"" into ""muscle"", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally
separate, and one does not ever ""change into"" the other.

Hmm.  This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack
therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack.  There are unethical

I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think

For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin
for ""candida hypersensitivity syndrome.""  It was published in the 
New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic
symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not
surprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections
to the study, though I don't remember what they were.

BTW, I think you're a bit of base yourself, since, to my knowledge, the

Summary: Two important clarifications to previous post of mine ...


This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been
pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.

1.  I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used 
    to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is 
    misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.
    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug
    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute 
    it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this
    distinction becomes important.

2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible 
	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something
	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or
	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  
	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual
	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they
	are an unending source of anxiety.  
	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with 
	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to
	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

	Some references (one non-technical and several technical)

The principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in
psychology called 'entrainment,' whereby external sensory stimuli
influence gross electrical patterns of brain function.

They are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they
are _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.  
Given the exception of TENS and similar units used for external electrical 
stimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine.

They are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical 
category to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the FDA does not 
specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.   

>I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,

There are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects
for mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with 
meditation or self-hypnosis as well.  Reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and
subjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential value.

A pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety
of these devices may be found in ""Would the Buddha Wear a Walkman ?""
Some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews
of specific equipment.

A more important question might be whether they have enough additional
value to be worth investing in.  'Biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate
and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in that
it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously 
considered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable 
therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and
temporary nature of the effects in most cases.   Maybe someone else 
has more, there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines,
somewhere on the net.

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese

I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because
it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some*
people.  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over
what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting
reports of what is good/bad for you.

One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical 
literature to keep up with changes in medical practice.  All the clamor 
over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical 
trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against 
cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, 
treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals 
are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden 
Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize 
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use 
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to 
restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is 
yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care 
patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just 
because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that 
all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be 
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida 
colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common 
than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by 
a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is 
warrented.

Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There 
has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is 
kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been 
done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the 
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones 
from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to 
breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of 
Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, 
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is 
restricting calcium intake.

The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to 
be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.
If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans 
David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider 
yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as 
Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline.

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root
beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  The leaves contain either
no
or less saffrole than the bark.

There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from
sassafras products.  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which
is
claimed to have the saffrole removed.

Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make 
root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human
consumption.
Also, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen
bark,
she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human 
consumption.

I find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile
live
in fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny, in a sick way.

The doctor thinks a friend might have this.
The question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ?

You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk
in the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before
it bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something
you're not likely to forget.

Can you get the fever without it biting you ?  Do they
sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize
you were bitten ?  I know they will let go once they've had
their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).

So how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick

There is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing

I guess I'm still not clear on what the term ""candida bloom"" means,
but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.
This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the ""quack""
diagnosis that has been being discussed.

Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a 
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would
rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

>yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as

Again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.
There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy.

I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test
showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off
a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult
to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which
keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.

Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for
several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to
be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I
found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
another programmable system called ReSound.

Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for
about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.
Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was
impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I
will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one
patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound
even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.

The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the
Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the
difference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am
having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would
appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections
about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite
so expensive.

I was wondering if a group called 'sci.pharmacology' would be relevent.
This would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological
issues (pharmacodynamics, neuropharmacology, etc.)

Just an informal proposal (I don't know anything about the net.politics
for adding a newsgroup, etc.)

Subject: ReSound hearing aid theory as I understand it
Organization: University of Oregon
Lines: 41
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: rhaller.cc.uoregon.edu

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in
Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other
'new' technology for hearing aids.

The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and
appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that
a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and
programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of
the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help
out in 'noisy' situations.

The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the
spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),
apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in
the low frequencies, while the important consonant information
(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are
treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have
also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call
'abnormal growth of loudness'.

This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I
think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you
exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit
becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach
the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means
that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high
end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively
less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.
You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially
differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially
for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls
off a cliff).

Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low
and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency
information because of high volume of low frequency components.
Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech
and in simulated restaurant noise situations.

  Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly
understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections
- which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. 
Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and
biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns
this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel
decontamination directed at retaining ""good"" anaerobic flora in an attempt
to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also
use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may
be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of
my routine practice to ""reinnoculate"" patients with ""good"" bacteria after
antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a ""logical
extension"" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who
base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
clinical trials. 
  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There
are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate
the patients flora.  Don't try this at home.

  Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal
conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical
trial, like: 

AU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D.
TI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the
     candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments]
SO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.
     psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens
     and the all-placebo regimen
     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than
     0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms
     significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]
     CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis
     hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or
     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,
     the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such
     women appears to be unwarranted.

  Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was not
surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite
Crook's recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didn't avoid those
carbohydrates . . .

  Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric
itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic
hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin
therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with
systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and
risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about ""real""
candida infections, the whole ""yeast connection"" hypothesis, the efficacy
of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally
effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm
an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem to
focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.

Subject: PMS-Can It Be Prevented By A Diet Change?

Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer 
here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human 
nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do 
when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.
I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the 
mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and 
their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that 
most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by 
diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting 
your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is 
justified.

> Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got 
side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most 
physicians don't recognize it as a specific ""disease"" entity.  Here is 
everything that you would ever want to know about PMS.

Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:

	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression)
	anxiety			depression
	irritability		forgetfulness
	insomnia		confusion
	depression		lethargy

	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration)
	craving for sweets	weight gain
	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness
	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness
	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities
	 2. palpitations
	 3. fatigue or fainting
 
PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low 
progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.

PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple 
carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is 
increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose 
challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are 
a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia 
is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of 
hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.
	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).
Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium 
supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of 
the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources 
of alpha linoleic acid.

PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead 
toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase). ""Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human 
endometrial cystol"" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).

PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated 
serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E 
for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H

This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:

	A. ""Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for 
	    a nutritional approach"". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. 
	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.

	B. ""Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension 
	    syndromes"", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).

	C. ""Premenstrual tension"", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)

Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can 
find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one 
that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, 
supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really 
has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida 
blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental 
controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to 
see done).

Here are a few of these studies:

	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, ""Effect of a low-fat, 
	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy"" Lancet 
	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 
	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 
	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories 
	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 
	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant 
	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 
	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as 
	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, 
	tenderness and nodularity.

	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, ""The use of Vitamin A in 
	premenstrual tension"" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  
	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU 
	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored 
	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 
	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the 
	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 
	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this 
	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose 
	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% 
	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.
  	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 
	symptoms.

	Experimental Controlled Study, ""Premenstrual tension treated with 
	vitamin A"" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts 
	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their 
	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.
  	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 
	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 
	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 
	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms 
	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 
	vitamin A supplementation was stopped.

Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  
These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal 
store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins 
given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best 
single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid 
(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full 
of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent 
the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying 
to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin 
A toxicity.

	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, ""Pyridoxine
	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover 
	trial""J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 
	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.
  	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 
	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 
	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS 
	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The efects of vitamin B6 
	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms"" Obstet. Gynecol 
	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 
	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence 
	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 
	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as 
	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)
  	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 
	supplementation.

Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control 
pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  
Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per 
day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. 
Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in 
Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be 
considered the ""first-line"" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the 
patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin 
B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each 
day. 


	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Efficacy of alpha-
	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome"" J. Reprod. 
	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 
	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a 
	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast 
	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant
 	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% 
	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo 
	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant
	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The effect of alpha-tocopherol on 
	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study"" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 
	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 
	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 
	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 
	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly 
	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H
	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 
	PMT-H symptoms).
	
	MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Magnesium prophylaxis 
	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium"" Headache 
	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 
	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 
	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 
	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index 
	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment 
	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 
	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  
	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 
	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 
	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised 
	into the normal range.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Oral Magnesium successfully 
	relieves premenstrual mood changes"" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 
	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 
	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 
	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received 
	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 
	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the 
	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 
	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on 
	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 
	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium 
	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 
	that occur during PMS.

There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the 
medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder 
that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But 
since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. 
to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are 
also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on 
multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the 
best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out 
that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize 
nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, 
pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor 
being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS 
is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional 
disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.

Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral 
supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.

	Experimental Study, ""Effect of a nutritional programme on 
	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis"", Complement. Med. 
	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and 
	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, 
	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to 
	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate 
	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an 
	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that 
	they no longer suffered from PMS. 


	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Role of Nutrition in managing 
	premenstrual tension syndromes"", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  
	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite 
	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet 
	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the 
	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 
	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 
	phase of their cycle.

	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Clinical and biochemical effects 
	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome"", J. 
	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 
	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a 
	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another
 	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this 
	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on 
	PMS symptoms was observed.

Hi,

Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in
combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of 
available water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike
recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous
hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).
I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was
dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue,
since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
stamina, so far as I could tell.

It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I am
wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things.
I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma
(24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both those
drugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they can
reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be a
particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather
exercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but
that wasn't the case yesterday.)

EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove 
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such 
use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung 
disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side
-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also 
binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when 
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that 
were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove 
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C 
and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra 
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium 
from the plaques).

The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably 
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns 
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.

	1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""
	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with 
	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 

	2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 
	    disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the 
	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be 
	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.

	3. ""Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis 
	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits"" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).  
	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of 
	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol 
	   added to their normal food.

Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for 
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.

Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.  L. 
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily 
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of 
the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. 
bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told 
me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several 
different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't 
told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative 
anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a 
chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria 
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal 
region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida 
blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from 
the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do 
believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower 
colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the 
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.
Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get 
rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out.

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical 
trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal 
candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the 
frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the 
candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus 
should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the 
intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to 
oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the 
lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really 
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.


The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all 
conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if 
conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard 
medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?
The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very 
important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria 
after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason 
to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply 
and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause
pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make 
it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum,
but it might be possible.

So, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant.
Also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse
without rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is,
of course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.

 Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions
Commemorate Workers Memorial Day
 To: National Desk, Labor Writer
 Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130

   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions
of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth
annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6
million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.
   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an
the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.
Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert
Vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections
facility in Lucasville, Ohio.
   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady
increase in the prison population for the past five years.  On
Jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections
show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an
expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.
   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has
created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the
number of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against
staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain
high.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,
compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.
   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous
combination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio
officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in
the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and
safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis
B, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.
   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's
federal, state and local correctional facilities.
   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under
life-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers
die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from
occupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's
most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:

   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and
      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are
      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.
   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of
      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector
      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more
      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private
      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the
      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care
      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes
      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses
      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety
      issues facing health care workers include exposure to
      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high
      levels of stress.
   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health
      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,
      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man
      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler
      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.
      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the
      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a
      growing lack of support services for people who don't have
      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some
      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.
      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.
      The ""quality"" of the clients is also becoming more violent,
      as more are moved out of the institutions.

   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards
since OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.
McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety
protections for public employees.
   ""More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the
job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA
coverage for public employees,"" said McEntee.  ""This, despite the
fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,
corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most
dangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for
passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater
rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees
safe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.""
   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private
sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more
severe.
   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed
in 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states
have no OSHA coverage.

Point 1:

I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole
""yeast issue"" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings
of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized ""jargon"",
necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully
cognizant of since I, too, speak ""jargonese"" when with my peers).  For the
situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can
have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the
world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,
and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of ""systemic"".
It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much
more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of
this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially
equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan
the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get
really ""beat up"" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they
otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional
""difficult"" patient.

Point 2:

I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not
prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments
have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed
clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are
part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any
differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it
follows that any therapy not on the ""accepted"" list is therefore a non-
therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or
theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation
of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from
a treatment point-of-view.

And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/
science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as
also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people
that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where
""standard"" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and
wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid ""scientific"" viewpoint is in
itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying
intent of the ""scientific"" approach to medicine is to protect the health of
the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the
patient should come first when considering treatment.

What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both
the ""scientific"" and the ""humanitarian"" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I
outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any
physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe
alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)
for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted
(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such
therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that
there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived
from them.

This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies
the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients
who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted
medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the
doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing
their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical
training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control
more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned
could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most
productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm
sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented
more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.

Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to
why I am ""open"" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real
difficulty (read ""apparent hostility"") with the ""coldness"" of the 99.9% pure
""scientific"" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical
treatment is one where both the ""humanitarian"" aspects are balanced with and
by the ""scientific"" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.
Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)

THE diarrhea problem?  WHAT diarrhea problem?  First, candidal overgrowth is
not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of
antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.  But a case
of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going
to surprise anyone either.  That's not what people are disagreeing with.

Oh, really?  Where'd you come up with this?  You know, it's really
appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters
in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature.
Bobbing for citations in the research literature isn't medicine.
I hope you're not giving the wrong idea to your medical students.

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ******

Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu>
Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC
Date: Thursday April 15, 1993

ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's
health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest
findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will
put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.

Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled ""Emerging
Infectious Diseases"" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality
Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community.
The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific
counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing
threat of infectious ailments.

""This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
to deal with it,"" said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases.

There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year
since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic,
the first in this century, she said.

Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.
""We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past""
Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in
children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.

""Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases
would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases
remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness
and death in the United States,"" the CDC said.

It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a ""myriad"" of newly
identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a
deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.

""The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,
such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,""
the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been
undermined by drug resistance.

HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues

The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
damage: legal liability.

A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not
doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much
attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like
illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners
on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
someone becomes infected while on the property.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came
after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the
Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the
disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered
the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than
$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical
expenses and lost wages.

Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or
semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.
Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a
legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
barbecue might be potentially liable.

Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer
vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home
she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky
Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered
an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was
stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent
quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence
that a beehive was near the restaurant.

But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the
country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic
states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this
particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.

The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
diagnosing the disease.

Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease
have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in
worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and
lost earnings.

The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more
lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of
negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing
injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a
result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property
owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
disease.

Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &
Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help
to establish ""the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
against Lyme disease.""

Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a
lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For
one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs
in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned
by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.
The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
some work sites.

A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding
that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says
the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
pants to protect against bug bites.

Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up
some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a
victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.
Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.
And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.

Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies
already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last
year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &
Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston
that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-
supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company
was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
get infected.

Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in
Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her
organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole
Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners
Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their
100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing
pesticide.

TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.
AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,
Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson
University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30

Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is
associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients
with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.
Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and
detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract
may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding
dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may
directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the
Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological
symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological
deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme
disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential
diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder
management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
evaluation is recommended.

Subject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles

  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the
compost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became

>>>Can men get yeast infections? Spread them? What kind of symptoms?

My ENT doctor told me that it is not uncommon for the wife to get a vaginal
yeast infection after the husband takes antibiotics.  In fact this recently
happened to my wife.  Explanation is that the antibiotics kill the yeast's
competition, they then thrive and increased yeast around the penis spread
the infection during intercourse.  I was on ceclor for 30 days, then my wife
got the yeast.

Three possible results after interview:
1) rejection outright
2) acceptance outright
3) the infamous 'wait list'... 

If you are on a 'wait list', your entrance into medical school
is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their
acceptance.  This can happen as late as day -1 of starting
classes.

You can always call the admissions office.  The secretaries
should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your
application.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries
have more power than you might realize, and you never know-
could be the dean of admissions answering the phone.

> Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i

If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate
yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing
you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular
accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*
want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out
in the first semester of med school because they found it was
not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four
years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a
career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be
pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant
other.  

If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you
can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from
a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive
recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous
professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't
be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest
and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,
sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I
have turned down writing recommendations for some students
because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful
comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them
at that point.  

Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English
professor or some other friendly person with skill and
experience in writing and proof-reading and get their
criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you
say it.

Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor
in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further
coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help
here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut
courses, it usually shows.

Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in
local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;
substantial leadership roles in an organization help also.
Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to
spot and weed out.

Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why
you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal
of skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in
applying to any program, medical or what-have-you.

Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting
is the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)

My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated
nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures).
One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this
for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection,
discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently 
confirmed the problems in the sinuses.

He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal,
and sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty.

He explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is if
there is anyone out there who can tell me ""I had this surgery, and it helped
me""?

(I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't
really help them).

I am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved.

I am 42.

It isn't bogus.  I had chronic vaginal yeast infections that would go away
with cream but reappear in about 2 weeks.  I had been on 3 rounds of
antibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on
amoxicillin also for a sinus infection.  After six months of this, I went

days incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth (it was confirmed by
the lab).  A round of Nizerol for him cleared both of us.

Nasopharyngeal cancer is (roughly, don't have references at hand) 20-30
times more prevalent in Chinese than Caucasians, particularly those Chinese
from southern China.  One province (or region) has an extraordinary excess. 
The Chinese and others have done major studies.  Some association with

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues
such as this.  This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and
time again.  The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances,
both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of
circumcision are minor.  This means that the decision is left to
the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the
parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or
caregivers, at worst. 

As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this
regard and not worry about it too much.  In terms of decisions
you make for your child, it will have far less importance than
many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents
think about only a little. 

This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who
feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a
momentous medical decision.  It is not.

First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,

Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an

2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled

reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous.
It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than

But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own

I've mentioned this study a couple of times now: Ingestion of yogurt

vaginitis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7.  Do you
have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than

The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of
yogurt.  There was a marked decrease in infections while women were
ingesting the yogurt.  Problems with the study included very small
numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only
21 patients were analyzed).  Still, the difference in rates of infection
between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
believable.

The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  It is a protozoan that 
lives and multiplies within cells.  In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the
intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa can
cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomatic
after the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindness
and mental retardation.

Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant
women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  In addition, whoever
does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling
anything else, especially food.

Information came from _The Merck Manual, 15th Ed._

I hope this information is helpful to you.

This request goes out to medical students who have done
or are planning to sit the USMLE (or National Boards) Part 1.

My wife is sitting this examination in early June this year and would
like to have a look at some old National Boards, Part 1 questions
found in the following books. These books are currently out of print.
 

The books are:

(1) Retired NBME Basic Medical Science Test Items, NBME;
    Published by NBME in 1991

(2) Self-test in the Part 1 Basic Medical Sciences, NBME;
    Published by NBME in 1989

I would appreciate if anyone who has these books is willing
to loan it to her for a couple of days. Obviously, I would
reimburse for you all postage and related charges. Failing
that it would be beneficial if anyone could point to any
library in the NY, NJ or PA area that may have these books.

Please respond by e-mail since I do not read this newsgroup
regularly.

Thanks in advance.

I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she
can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. I
guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance...

The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be
going to school on a South Pacific island. Tell her to check the Journal
or Urology for circumcision articles. I remember at least 1 on an old
Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the
cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like
crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a
little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like
mastubation. So you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary.

-Allergy medicine, huh?  Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or
whatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an
antihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up
and eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you
what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms,
then fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs
the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing
up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it
again when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know what
the side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed the
safety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take
the risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get it
prescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy
specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I am
allergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat have
nothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't really
an option; there are too many permutations.

Yes, I've noticed that - and I can work it up by eating just under the tolerance
level fairly regularly.  If I don't eat anything except home cooking for a month
or so I lose it and have to work it up from scratch... a bad experience.  Now I
know what the early-warning symptoms are, though, I can usually tell whether I am
allergic to food before I've eaten too much of it... usually...

Yup.  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between

the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases.  Turns out the effect isn't

I saw this a few years ago on ""Tomorrow's World"" (low-brow BBC
technology news program).  The patient is lowered into a bath of
de-ionized water and carefully positioned.  High intensity pressure
waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get
electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  These waves are
focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to
break up.  This is completely painless.

Of course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through
the urethra.  Ouch!

I saw the same thing happen to my father, and I can more or less validate your
take on hospitals.  It seems to me that medical science understands precious
little about taking care of the human machine.  Drugs are given as a
response to symptoms (and I guess that makes sense since all the studies that 
validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow
assessment of the degree of particular symptoms).  But there seems
to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person
outside of the numbers that appear on a test.  I watched my dad
wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue
while in the hospital.  There is something a little crazy about a
system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every
latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you
have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue.  It is
really, really bizarre.

Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling)
photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrow-minded, ""I know it all"", ""I don't believe what I can't see or
measure"" attitude of many people out there.

I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to
so-called ""paranormal"" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just
as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists,
were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.

Especially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth.

Dear Netters:

Maybe one of you can explain this.  From time to time I experience 
a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which 
can be best described as the feeling of ""losing gravity"", like that one 
experiences in a descending elevator.  Needless to say, it is not 
enjoyable.  It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme 
fatigue.  It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts 
that long, it makes me sweatening.

Initially I called it ""palpitation (spelling?)"" until I later learnt that 
the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.

So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person?
I always believe I am unique. 

Thanks.

I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better.  I applied
to about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to
hear from the other school.

Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical
school admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, 
but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some
schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look
at your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund
on your $50 application fee.

But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers
and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it
an acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a
denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How
did your interviews go?

As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted
me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was
over and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection
letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are
still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become
fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.

What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very
mediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software
engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,
I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted
is something like this:

VERY IMPORTANT
--------------
GPA:	3.5 or better
MCAT:   top 15% in all subject

MEDIUM IMPORTANCE
-----------------
Writing/Speaking ability
Maturity
Motivation for going into medicine
Activities

LESS IMPORTANT
--------------
College or University
Major
Work experience
Anything else you want them to know


Anyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in
many ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each
person as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting 
four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, you
were able to impress them with your character.


Good luck,
Jeff

The use of shock waves (not ultrasound) to break up stones has been
around for a few years.  Depending on the type of machine, and intensity
of the shock waves, it is usually uncomfortable enough to require

Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, Uncle Sam!).  I've been
wearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to be
acceptable.  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned to 
your hearing curve.  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, if
you're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the
ear models, that's not an issue).  The cost:  I paid $1200 each for mine,
through the Miracle Ear counter at Sears.  I've heard that there is a
substantial discount for senior citizens, but I haven't researched that, because
I'm not a senior citizen, yet!

Give them a try; you might be pleasantly surprised!

David, this study looks like a good one.  Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline 
search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since 
commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or 
bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.
This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are 
recommended rather than yogurt.

I guess the next question is why would this introduction of ""good"" bacteria 
back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the 
anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy
denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a 
facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and 
colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain 
the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion 
was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the 
intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida 
looses it's major food source.

Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is 
normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal 
yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has 
been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in 
the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting 
their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their 
patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if 
ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age 
emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the 
medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to 
help patients or does it look the other way.

This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous 
therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But 
there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty 
hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only 
well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or 
do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to 
work yet?

My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they 
involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into 
the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other 
is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a 
problem with recurring yeast infections.

	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'

    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography
    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic
    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's
    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research 
    named A. J. Ellison.

    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison
    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of
    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than
    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing
    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and
    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
    usually also tracer chemicals.

Money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine 
circumcision alive... It's another opporitunity to charge a few hundred
extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure, the rationale for 
which until recently has been accepted without question by most
parents of newborns.  

One could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision
(infections, sloppy jobs, etc) are far more common than the remote chance
of penile cancer it is purported to prevent.

I think I can explain the ""missing part of a leaf"" story.

I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian
photograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of
Kirlian photography.  ""That particular photograph"" ... ?  That's
right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of
the book were inclined to disbelieve in it.  

I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing
a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo.
For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down
between the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The
""missing half"" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind 
after the first photo.

This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't there
when it happened.

It is one thing to be open-minded about phenomona that have not
be demonstrated to be false, and quite another to ""believe"" in
something like Krilian photography, where *all* the claimed effects
have be demonstrated to be artifacts.  There is no longer any reason
to adopt a ""wait and see"" attitude about Krilian photography, it
has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal
discharge.  The ""auras"" shown by missing leaf parts came from 
moisture left by the original whole leaf, for example.  

That's what science is, son.

I used to be on lopid.  It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295
down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I got
pneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well;
cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilized
over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch
to Mevicore.  

On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108, 
and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still
very high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, 
SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).

He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him
concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol
figures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (""Just
to be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem.""),
and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid might
be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what
I want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of.

Should the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens to
folks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the above
results?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient 
side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected my

This effect disappears if you clean your apparatus after you kirlianed

hi all, i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i
shoulda went into more detail... Being my anxiety level is peaking and you
folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what
you people think regarding my previous post.
To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.

as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), the
results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)

3 schools i heard nothing from at all.

I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no
info whatsoever to tell me.

I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles
and a few ""safety""  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first
to reject me)

my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR
I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art
history, politics etc 

Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work
for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.

I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What
percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?
I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm
acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the
mailbox anxiety?  

If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments
for me feel free to send them down... Typing is a form of anti-anxiety
thereapy hehehehe :)

It is evident you did not read my post carefully. I wasn't
trying to tell you not to eat MSG products and produce, nor was I
arguing for or against MSG. I was simply questioning the logic of
your statement that simply because
(a) one is not allergic to something, and
(b) likes eating that
it follows that one could keep eating whatever it is. 
In my post, I had clearly said that I don't know enough about MSG.
The statement ""don't eat X because its bad"" is just _your_

Subject: Schatzki Ring/ PVC's
Reply-To: ohandley@betsy.gsfc.nasa.gov
Organization: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center - Greenbelt, MD USA
Lines: 49

Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the
following two health problems:

First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a
Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it,
the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally
have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki
ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,
if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,
food occasionally gets ""stuck"" before reaching my stomach. This results
in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.
Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,
and causes frequent discomfort.

My doctor wants to ""dilate"" the ring using the
following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach
for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing
some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know
if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,
was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on
safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become
a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding
procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,
especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,
reaction to anesthesia).

The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number
of ""extra"" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there
has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24
hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,
however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist
indicated that such a number was ""normal"". It certainly doesn't
feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of
extended ""runs"" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause
severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good
health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or
caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as ""normal"", but don't
want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number
of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something
as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying
down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly
be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the
same time.

Thanks for any help/advice!

A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a

condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all
this time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'
HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney.
When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a
technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she
says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't help
feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She
is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was
happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got
worried.
	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her
and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April...
She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to
classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to
call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these
questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I
could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems
o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this
or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan to
get a second opinion, too. 

	I will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get information
from more than one source.

Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes.

 New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at
Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported
 To: National Desk, Health Writer
 Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or
          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research
          Institutes.

   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing 
and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain
which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been
discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research
Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research
will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,
Radiology.
   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led
by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly
patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of
dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special
software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical
Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses
in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton
MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination
time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10
minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testing
for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and
neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the
patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.
   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS
exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including
AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's
disease.
   ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly
and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted
with either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding,
""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and
intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease
causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""
   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the
brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker
in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed
with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their
level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was
significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons
believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.
   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely
considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross
believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an
interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to
the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15
years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based
on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.
   ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate
Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or
her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment
protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we
consider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said Bruce
Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher
and a co-author of the study.
   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,
Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,
R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200
General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,
and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.
   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology
May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or
Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.

   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:

   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of
the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist
Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of
memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,
loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.
   How many people does it affect?
   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in
the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking
approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's
debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both
emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the
most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every
year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.
   What are its signs and symptoms?
   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have
been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk
of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50
yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life
to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial
AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of
developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness""
caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School
of Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness is
a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" and
suggests the following criteria:

   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is
      normal.
   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.
   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.
   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.

   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be
evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms
of dementia.

It sounds as though you might want to try a product such as ""super-glue"".
The active ingredient is cynoacrylate, the same compound used to reconstruct
bones.  I have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many
different species of animal. If you are simply trying to adhear something
to bone for several months, this would be ideal. It bonds almost immediatly,
is resistant to infection, and is non-irritating to surrounding tissue.

I've had the usual ""skin prick"" tests for the

>Thanks.

You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which
are used for chemotherapy.

The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of
these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy
cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different
effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than
one drug at a time.

Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle
of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.

The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis
and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.
The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized 
aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.

There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.
Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.
At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells
to stop growing.

If what you are seeking is ""practical"" advice, I apologize for rambling
on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs
are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to 
experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small
frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter
known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines
tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications 
can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.

Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always
happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person 
themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different
side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug
headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably
by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this
too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.

I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.
They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,
if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend ""Reach for Recovery"".
It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast 
because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.

If you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good
access to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.

I wish the best to you and your friend.

Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research
that there is.  Advantages stated of circumcison included probably
prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men
whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal
hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of
a unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the 
procedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off
the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did
a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school.
It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use
the reasoning that they will ""look like Daddy"" and like their friends
as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is
what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise
a male, although a major surgical procedure exists.

>How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?  We've heard

As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any
problems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water.
HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME!
It is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of ""public""
hot tubs.  A nice warm bath can be very relaxing, especially if your back
is killing you!  And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath
soap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection.

Hope these tips help you some.

 Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article 
 on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who
 sponsored that study.
 I have seen too many ""nutrition"" bulletins over the years from
 local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the
 bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
 compliments of the Dairy Industries.
 There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
 financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
 benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.

 Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
 in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study
 didn't say that, it only claimed that ""most kidney stones are large-
 ly calcium.""
 Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
 opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
 are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.
 
 Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still 
 the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention 
 of kidney stones.
 I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
 one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
 stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE
 in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
 type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
 from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complications
from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery.
The risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large,
hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia. 
Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction.
And the smaller the hernia is, the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will
become incarcerated or strangulated.

I've tried it, and so has one friend of mine.  No known side effects or
risks.  It didn't seem to work for us, but several studies now have 
suggested it does work for many people, so I think it's worth a try.

You can find it in capsule form at health food stores.  Up to six capsules
a day was recommended, if I remember correctly.  It can also be prepared 
as a tea.

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,
however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their
ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery, though.

About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,
""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -
not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,
as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  I'm
rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature
in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  So, the righteous among
them will no doubt jump on that.

Also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption
that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the
GI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for
maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.

Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even
though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his
nineties--but nevermind about that.  He shouldn't charge for his
equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the
FDA.  Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can
charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as
thalidomide.  But nevermind about that either.

Unfortunately, you dared to step into the sacred turf of Net.Medical.
Discussion without a credential and without understanding that the
righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced
before dismissing you as a fool.

But maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will

Oh yes, I did have a point.  A few years ago an MD with a thriving

I take such treatments to clear up a skin condition.  (Not through his

sure an unusual prescription!

My opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.  
Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays 
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation 
is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical 
formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus 
in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may 
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care 
to comment?).

Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, 
I don't think that there are many drugs that can help ""dissolve"" the 
kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium 
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that 
a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery 
is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second 
opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break 
up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are 
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  
My condolences to your friend.

What is the healthiest way to deal with earwax?  Should one just leave
it in your ear and not mess with it, or should you clean it out

Are there any tubes in your ear that might get blocked?

I don't think there is a general distinction.  Rather, there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis.  I can't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.

Much as these two terms ""chronic active"" and ""chronic persistent""
sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well.

We know that sermon.  It is posted roughly every month or so by different
persons, and that doesn't make it any better.

How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing
one's mind to other possibilities.

I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that,
instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice,
be open-minded.

If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that
it's always those ""neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever"" types who 
narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.

Do I ever!!!!!!  After 2 years of having health problems that had been
cleared up w/allery shots, and not knowing why, I went and was re-tested.
I actually did better than when I had been tested 2 years ago....
Then putting 2 + 2 together, I realized that it all started back up
when the laser printer came into the office.  I kept track of the usage, and
on hi use days, I was worse.  I got better over the weekends....

The laser printer is gone, I'm 100% better!!!..... Whether it is the toner
dust or chemicals, I dont know (I am highly allergic to dust...), but
it definitely was the laser printer....

Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a

seem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe
limits.

I looked at a ""Balanced 100"" time release formulation from Walgreen's
and noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA.  Is
this safe?!?.

Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for?

	Millipedes, I understand, are vegetarian, and therefore almost
certainly will not bite and are not poisonous. Centipedes are
carnivorous, and although I don't have any absolute knowledge on this, I

Yes, this is a common and safe procedure.  The majority of Schatzki's

instead of the congenital Schatzki's ring.  Occassionally a cancer

I' not an expert on heart problems, but PVC's are common and have been
overtreated in the past.  My personal experience, and I have the same 
history an build you do (related to the heart, that is), is that my PVC's
come and go, with some months causing anxiety.  Taking on more fluids
seems to help, and they seem worse in the summer.  Remember that a slow 
heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent, so perhaps it is an 
indication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that
last point, especially)

Good luck, hope we don't die of arrhythmias.  (God, what a happy thought)

The bacteria in your gut are important.  But colonic flushes are not the 
way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of 
bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of 
antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in 
your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real 
problem in some of the outfits that do this ""treatment"" since the equipment 
is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient ""treatments"".
Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've 
picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his 
instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is 
also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and 
disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than 
the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much 
higher fees do not drive away patients.

I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to 
this colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you 
subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV.
Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?
Could they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a 
pathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not 
cleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk?
Food for thought.

Food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the
young.  Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to
bottle feedings, but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet.  Your
pediatrician should be able to give you a list of foods to avoid.

Not sure of this but I think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction (sting?
So I would not assume that they are not dangerous merely on the basis of

You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal
obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine,
hyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) )
[Riga IN. Rev d'Oto-Neuro-Ophthalmol 1957;24:325-335], cardiac symptoms
[Jackson RT. Annals of Otology 1976;85:65-70  Cvetnic MH, Cvetnic V. Rhinology
1980;18:47-50     Cottle MH. Rhinology 1980;18:67-81], and fever, inadequate
oral intake and electrolyte imbalance [Fairbanks DNF. Otorhinolaryngology Head
and Neck Surgery 1986;94:412-415).

So before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a MEDLINE
search on the topic say back to 1966. There's been extensive literature on this
for over a 100 years.

I may be in cardiology but I've had a very good working relationship with
my colleagues from ENT.

Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss, congestion or popping
in the ears, you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a
bulb syringe, but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or
may even make things worse.  (My wife would disagree, she does it
successfully every six months or so.)  In any case DO NOT ATTEMPT
ANYTHING WITH Q-TIPS!!!

My experience has been that this is initially best handled by a
Ear/Nose/Throat person.  I say initially, because an ENT can evaluate
whether or not you might have success on your own with a little
instruction.

I am not a physician (obviously, because I eschew the term

Subject: Great Canadian Scientists
Organization: CSS, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada
Lines: 155

About two years ago I posted the following:
 
I am planning to write a new book called ""Great Canadian Scientists.""
Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca
 
The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have
to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have
had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great
Canadian scientists.
 
About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the
end of this posting.
 
I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a
gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be
pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are
not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.
 
Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so
that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then
give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why
you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.
 
After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones
and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy
Kidder's ""Soul of a New Machine"" or some other dramatic technique.
The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with 
one paragraph biographies.
 
If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear
them.
 
So far, I have received 68 nominations as follows:

Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I
feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now
I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.
 
If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop
me a line.
==================================================
 
That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science
Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the
book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book
for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about
40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic
boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of
the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few
moments in the life of the scientist, ""What I was doing when I was 12"",
So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There 
will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph
biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing
will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added
richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may
also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in
Canada as well.
 
I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close 
to being it. Hope to find one soon. 
 
I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the
pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of 
the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.
 
I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian
Scientists, and to discuss what is ""great"" what is ""Canadian"" and what is
""scientist"".

(WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLED

 Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think.

 The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was
 also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could
 not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be
 able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing
 weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead,
 they expected him to die at sea.

 Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles,
 making the trip practical.

 Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is
 indeed 25K miles.

 Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right
 about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.

Subject: med school

Lines: 27

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is 
relevant for med students too.

Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.
Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, 
histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass 
memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most 
med students are.

Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I 
have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have
never applied them to large amounts of ""data"".

Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or
cheap software?   

Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an
older student who returned to school this year, organization (another
one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.

Please no griping about how all you have to do is ""learn"" the material
conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong 
points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is
rote memorization.  

Thanks for your help.

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological 
(esp. neurological) conditions induced by playing video games
(e.g. Nintendo). Apparently, there have been reported several cases of
""photosensitive epilepsy"", due to the flashing of some
patterns and the strong attention of the (young) players.
One poster to comp.risks reported some action from
the British Government.

A quick search in a database reported the following two published
references:

1. E.J. Hart, Nintendo epilepsy, in New England J. of Med., 322(20), 1473
2. TK Daneshmend et al., Dark Warrior epilepsy, BMJ 1982; 284:1751-2.

I would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail) 
any reference to (preferably published) further work on the subject.
Any pointer to other information and/or to possible technical tools 
(if any) for reducing the risks are appreciated.

Many thanks,

As a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful 
sting, but it quickly subsided. Much less painful compared to a bee sting. 
Centipedes have a poison claw (one of the front feet) to stun their prey, but
in my single experience it did not have a lot of ""bite"" to it.

Depression can also have various chemical (environmental) components.
I noticed that I became depressed in various buildings, and at home
when the air conditioning was on. Subsequent testing revealed that
I was allergic to stemphyllium, a mold commonly found in air conditioners.
After I began taking antigens, that problem disappeared.

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any
medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain.

Either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have
to be extracted surgically.

When I was in, the X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney
stones and children, and the childbirth hurt less.

Demerol worked, although I nearly got arrested on my way home when I barfed

Lida,
I can emphasize with your situation.  Both my wife and I suffered from 
bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a 
rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and 
chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through 
her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When 
severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to 
use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had ""cured"" her PMS using 
supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet 
in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and 
she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after 
by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and 
one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another 
stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with 
supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. 
I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using 
B6, niacin, folate and B12 to ""cure"" depression.  I'm not going to do that 
because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.

Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the 
problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use 
an approach which will ""fix"" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly 
what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be 
affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these 
stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was 
pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is 
a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your 
bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), 
you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any 
nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from 
being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase 
your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become 
very important.

Lida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to 
try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming 
from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic 
Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because 
none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I 
preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by 
my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:

Indroduction and Carbohydrates 			Lipids

Proteins I					Proteins II

Energy Balance					Evaluation of Nutritional
						Status I, A Clinical 
						Perspective

Evaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional		
A Biochemical Perspective			Status III, Homework 
						Assignment Using the

						Phosphorus

Iodine and Fluoride				Other Trace Minerals

Vitamin A					Vitamin E

Vitamins D and K				Vitamin C

Thiamin and Niacin				Riboflavin and Pyridoxine

Pantothenic and Folic acids			Biotin and B12

Other Nutrient Factors				Enteral Nutrition

Parenteral Nutrition

Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature 
to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this 
in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down 
and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books 
that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which 
I write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various 
copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for 
educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not 
send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).

I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition 
assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need 
to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the 
nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to 
be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to 
design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment 
Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with 
hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a 
nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin 
Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup.

For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new 
Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I 
have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown 
series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more 
to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition
textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it 
does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a 
patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the 
Preface of this new text:

""So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, 
hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge 
of nutrition as it related to their field of practice.""  

""Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United 
States require no formal instruction in nutrition.""

""But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the 
leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.""

""... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it 
should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of 
nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your 
awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important 
for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially 
every organ system.""

Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH 

Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find 
a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals
(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and 
who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when 
women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are 
occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A 
nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned 
that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red 
cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium 
reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to 
try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are 
also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral 
analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using 
certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some 
pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone 
who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are 
using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Act).  

A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown 
to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging 
and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But 
there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not 
show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.
Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the 
U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional 
profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses 
diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue 
to be the best approach to depression.

Hi Stephen
Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the
external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some 
hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your
own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and
fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen
peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)
and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  
firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever
you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse
it out.
Good Luck

Ron, you are absolutely right.  Not all kidney stones have calcium and not 
all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-
oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article 
as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that 
conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably 
always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that 
you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of 
damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to 
sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).

On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical 
chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of 
calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to 
measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the 
serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good 
nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue 
reserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see 
how your technique compares with mine.

The millipede's around here (Austin) have no sting.  Some of the

There's always the old switcheroo.

My brother works at a dialysis clinic.  They were interviewing 
candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a
urine screen was part of the interview.  The bathroom was across
the hall from a lab.  One candidate managed to switch his urine
sample with one he grabbed from the lab.  (No one was in it at
the time.)

Most inner-city dialysis patients have quite a few medical problems,
so it was immediately obvious what had happened.  My brother 
fleetingly considered telling the candidate, ""I'm sorry but you
are very ill and need medical attention immediately.""  They offered
him another *well-monitored* chance and he declined.

I'll tell you all that I know about chromium.  But before I do, I want to 
get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney 
stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart 
disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to 
encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do 
most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from 
the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to 
be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.
Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have 
a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you 
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.
Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help 
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment 
program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When 
my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin 
E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, 
plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet 
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.
But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation 
and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as 
your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a 
regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her 
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even 
scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for 
the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).

One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses 
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have 
drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is 
really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and 
minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't 
be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a 
lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new 
Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab 
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet 
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you 
handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,
I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really 
don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think 
that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a 
few with an axe to grind.  That's life.

Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very 
important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor
(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine 
and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to 
form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,
and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is 
seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral 
chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest 
for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has 
come up there several times as a ""fat burner"".  Chromium is among the least 
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really 
do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for 
chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 
30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many 
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I 
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in 
Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there 
also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is 
bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when 
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to 
Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and 
glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is 
concerned

Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, 
this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little 
more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin 
responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity 
is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular 
pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with 
glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. 
Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt 
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, 
just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless 
they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often 
found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the 
RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would 
prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to 
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.

You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC 
chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a 
RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail 
analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny 
business going on in these unregulated labs right now.

Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider 
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is 
available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they 
also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not 
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change 
and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?
Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical 
response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium 
supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of 
CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.

What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then 
exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most 
Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have 
a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  
When he or she says, ""what in the world are you talking about"", just say, 
please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook 
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose 
tolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you 
very much.

deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in

hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients,
systemic candida infection.  I think ""The Yeast Connection"" is
a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught, anyway?

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the
mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, 
depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

I too have had premature ventricular heartbeat, starting in 1974.  (These 
are not, by the way, ""extra"" heartbeats.  This is how they feel, and 
this is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they're 
actually *premature* heartbeats.  I would sometimes experience a lapse 
after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time, 
making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.) 

I had them persistently for eighteen years.  Then I went on a low-fat 
diet, and they just stopped.  I haven't had a single episode of PVH 
for almost two years.  I know:  correlation does not imply causation. 
This is just FWIW.

Ok, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER ""Dr. Idiot""
story.


I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was
exhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in
the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.

AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as
I like to refer to him) said, ""Well, I am off duty now."" (still staring
between my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who
was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going
to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.

The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of
minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left
without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time 
during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get
there.

Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes
before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
next on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that
it was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that
fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a
few little minutes.



I have run into ""Dr. Idiots"", ""Mechanic Idiots"", ""Clerk Idiots"" and ""Etc.
Idiots"" in my time, but this fellow I would like to have words with.

First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  This is sci.med, not
alt.sex.

Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that ""American's are just too hung
up on the penis....blah,blah"".  I think most American's don't care about
anything so comlicated as that.  They just think it ""looks nicer"".  Ask 
a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it is
easier to clean.  Still others do it because ""Daddy was"".

Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality. 

My son is not circumcised, and I can vouch for the argument that it is
more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  Not so much that
the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my son
doesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced
feces.  So, many times it just gets a once over dab.  It worries me
that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation.  I am
sure, however, that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin
himself once he is old enough.  Until, there is always the decision at
each diaper change...is this the time to clean or can we wait till next
time.

I'll agree with your wife.  While I was a student, I had doctors remove
rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple
times, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and
said something like ""Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there"".  In my case,
removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and
I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with
warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little
bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -
I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.

One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  It
works, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.  Any
comments?

Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read 
""The Yeast Connection"".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing 
by this ""hated"" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?
Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.
A book that you should be familiar with and not ""hate"". ""Candida species 
colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly 
thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  
Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic 
mycosis.""  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic 
infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or 
""sick"" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.
Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute 
it.

What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic 
infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial 
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida 
blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: ""However, some factors, such as 
the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to 
both mucosal and systemic infections"".  I was addressing mucosal infections
(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers 
this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the ""cure"".  I guess that 
your nutrition course does not, too bad.

My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you 
noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.
Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point 
out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, 
pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist 
and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of 
Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.

You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small 
little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in 
Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.
I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what 
I've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into 
""The Yeast Connection"" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain 
and simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never

for years in Europe and for some time in Canada.  Trials in the U.S. were
completed and the drug hit the US market at the end of March.  Some
pharmacies don't stock it yet.  Presently it needs to be injected
subcutaneously; although testing is starting with a nasal spray form.  It
mimics serotonin (its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors

I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way
it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the
possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in
1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book
because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written
from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept
an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the ""yeast
connection"".

But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right
clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In
the meantime, I'd still encourage people who have ""incurable"" chronic sinus
problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to
administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with
liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It
is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT
says ""sorry, you'll just have to live with it"", it is time to step out and
try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence
(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At
this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and
have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive
clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with
relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I
saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of
course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not
work for you.  Talk to your doctor.

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy
of cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an
oncologist.

A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a
dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the
distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given
intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will
insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. 

After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the
body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high 
concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for
areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.

As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required
to start the IV line.

What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may
have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother
has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the
skeletal system.

I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if
you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related
to your mother's care.  I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing
information with other people to help them understand things that they did
not know about before.

My thoughts are with you both.

Organization: Electrical Eng. Dept. - New Mexico Tech
Lines: 46
Nntp-Posting-Host: baltic


	For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful
when I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also
pretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of
bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I
will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because
I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I
went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.

	Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to
get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;
but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So
I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly
and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually
felt refreshed the next morning.

	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and
experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am
presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The
antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought
some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't
notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about
1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research
seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest
sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic
form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good
dosage level to try.

	For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have
an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry
eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did
guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some
changes in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I
went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)

	Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of
antihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use
(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
millions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be
a serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,
whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have
tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to
lower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some
kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in
any other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried
many of the non-pharmacological solutions)

I have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  Some say
the lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  And I have
recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding
ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.   

My dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where I have
two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.
He says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large.
So, I would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam
and composite.  And, should I really even be worried about amalgam?  I
heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more- 
is this true.

Any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.

I'm interested in this from the other angle: what antihistamine can I
take at bedtime for relief of allergies, with the assurance that its
sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning, but
preferably with the anti-allergy effect lasting longer?

I'm thinking mainly of OTC products. Which has the least duration of
sedative action: Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, or what?
Note that I'm asking about duration, not intensity.

I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting,

over DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side
effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30).
Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal
spray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to
be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most
neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.

As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I 
was there, I asked him about dry skin. I'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments.
He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline,
to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you
can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick
to your clothes.
Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'
lotion.

The best thing to do is leave it, it will work its own way out to the surface.
Anything you stick up there to try and clean it is just going to push the wax

I've had cold sores in the past.  But they have always been in the

a cold sore, but on my lower lip in the middle (above the chin).

Can cold sores appear anywhere around the mouth (or body)?

Is there a medical term for cold sore?

Hi.

My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness
to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)
tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are
not very interested in starting medication as this ""deactivates"" the 
gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given
some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 
'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,
but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the 
brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) 

My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?
Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the
probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this
affect the treatment, development?

I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I
will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.

I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established
medical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relaying
events as they have happened.

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital
because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do
a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.

I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned
from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT
lab had been very unpleasant to her.

To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the
machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the
machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may
have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into
this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is
going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her
hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with
annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV
catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained
of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare
without any words of explanation.

Is there anything I can do about these pigs ?

I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day
out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative.
But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help
sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior.
Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the
people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that
sort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit.

Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that
neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion
of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

Thanks for listening,

Lines: 106

Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

Robert,

I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've 
been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.
I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just 
like I haven't read ""The Yeast Connection"").

Let me just start by stating that the authors of the ""Cold Fusion"" papers of 
recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually 
left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a 
review of the research notes of the ""cold fusion scientists"" actually 
proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.

Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay 
texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food 
combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.
But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent 
oxidative damage in the body).

Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove 
that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you 
use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees 
I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in 
commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this 
kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I 
couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really 
guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is 
that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to 
produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so 
they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. 

Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and 
in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve 
fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we 
really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with 
silicon?  Not in my book Robert.

Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation 
that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon 
based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I 
know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to 
separate the fiction from the fact.

Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in 
humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing 
there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know 
about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not 
because silicon is transformed into calcium).

Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective 
tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show 
that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective 
factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, 
the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity 
which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as 
part of the ageing process in humans).

For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which 
calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon 
in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the 
bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.
Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming 
cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in 
the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency
(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of 
defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also 
another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  
undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not 
transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing 
observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into 
calcium is an interesting little trick.

But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and 
yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without 
a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group 
are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any 
better).

If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, 
I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources 
that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems 
to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm 
going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us 
kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.

For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's 
interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric 
neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his 
name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in 
our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with 
brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses""unconventional""
treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one 
case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional 
treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the 
cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between 
radiation treatment and surgery is guys? 

I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the 
chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)
and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which 
do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it 
because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?
How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your 
sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).

Antihistamines have been the active ingredient of OTC sleep aids for
decades.  Go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as Sominex, Nytol, etc.  The active ingredient is:
diphenhydramine, the same antihistamine that's in Benadryl.

Well, that post was not that accurate.  People with early life hernias
are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.
The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  
However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is 
high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probably
no higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would
be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible
sigmoidoscopy.  Sorry for the misleading info.

There are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would cause
a hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid, mainly
thyroxin). Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is
generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections
usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the
case with your wife.
Thyroxin orally does ""shut down the thyroid"" through a feedback loop
involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary ""thinks"" that the
correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to
tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have
Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin
for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills
for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal.
I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.
The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at
beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at
least require closer monitoring of hormone levels.
Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness,
and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart),
changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.

I am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important
thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they
aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a
second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain
things in detail to you and your wife.

I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to 
posting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I've managed to 
delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send 
it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.
Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all 
day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has 
them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and 
Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to 
point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical 
community.

Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long 
time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've 
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.
Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in 
the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).

When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as 
the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have 
decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C
(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is 
also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).
The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if 
vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in 
both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).

Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and 
beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene 
is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other 
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human 
adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We 
are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 
30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they 
were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that 
of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is 
not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient 
reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.

The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of 
vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet 
surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A
(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National 
Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the 
RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 
7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was 
killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main 
reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient 
reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to 
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move 
towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have 
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely 
important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that 
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 
1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the 
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 
1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill 
the reserves).

We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a 
normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient 
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.
But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how 
much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has 
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol 
level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your 
liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal 
range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is 
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation 
of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level 
of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to 
vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative 
approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in 
this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty 
of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, 
redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).

I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they 
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear 
signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient 
needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you 
will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for 
PMS studies).

Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will 
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to 
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the 
liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But 
taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to 
fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% 
that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One 
other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not 
convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the 
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of 
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will 
cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.

Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body 
uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be 
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde
(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the 
retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses 
retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells 
and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, 
one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the 
title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play 
a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role 
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake 
of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But 
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once 
it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC 
group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.

Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are 
helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and 
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do 
themselves more harm than good.

Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.
In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus 
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from 
entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the ""first 
line"" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown 
to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which 
stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration 
and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters 
are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not 
normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.
This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials 
in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.

Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that 
vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who 
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be 
worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already 
has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my 
course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic 
medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.

Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night 
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The 
serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver 
reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have 
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled 
out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels 
were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 
20ug/dl.

As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of 
the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably 
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low 
serum retinol levels.

What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts
from their book:

Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for 
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for 
reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie 
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and 
metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, 
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not 
in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A 
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal 
range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are 
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater 
than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation 
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to 
perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to 
vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The 
bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal 
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 
7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts 
over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, 
erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois
(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  

They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A 
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol 
level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in 
adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule 
out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical 
lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give 
them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity 
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the 
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.

Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.
Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.
I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to 
fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the 
serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the 
vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a 
demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will 
provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status 
are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more 
agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But 
vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could 
become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human 
fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 
18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on 
the human fetus.

Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes 
but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use 
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it 
full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to 
prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup 
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A 
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I 
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market 
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general 
public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.

Subject: Seeking info on retinal detachment
Organization: Acadia University
Lines: 40

I am quite near sighted.

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.

My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
- several each hour.

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.

I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most
interest to me:

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action?

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards.

Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Many thanks

Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with
sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when
they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're
used on a nightly basis.  Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,
relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as
those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.

Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)
are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine
(Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work
well in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long
half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual
hangover or ""drugged"" feeling the next morning.

This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is
reported here is what the doctor actually said.  If your wife's
pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll
need insulin replacement.  That doesn't mean she's ""dependent"" on
insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make
enough, she'll have to get it elsewhere.  Oral thyroid replacement
hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and
it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  Plus, it's
cheap.  Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your
thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a
_feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of
hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing
enough.  There isn't a clinical phenomenon of ""thyroid insufficiency""
caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone
analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of
prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no
worry about inappropriately ""suppressing"" the thyroid gland.

to have a paradoxical effect?  I used to take one every night for

figured out it was the antihistamines.  I would fall asleep for a few

I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the

Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was
admitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argument
with the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignore
complaints until the patient becomes litigious. Clinicians may not
have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find

If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter.
Attach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you
do get a response.

CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner
can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting
study in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of
people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would

there's a few legal complications that arise:

	1. 
If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted

	2.
A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?)

	3.
Getting what you pay for.  (Deceptive ""bait and switch"" to an extreme...).  False

A placebo is an accepted treatment at times.

Why should it?  Placebos are effective under certain circumstances.  That's
why they're used.  

Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a ""sugar pill"".
I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always
labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the
name.

It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just
not for what you have.  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most
common such placebo.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  What do you think you're paying for?
You're not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a
doctor's appointment.

Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A(
retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by 
high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go 
on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on 
your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one.

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
depressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually
a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
condition is present.

I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,
but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is
caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical
imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular
everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
body at all.

The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -
one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in
the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other
hormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the
body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but
the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
short order.

Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's
reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)
and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local
library).

I hope this has been of some help.

Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state
that chromium ""cures diabetese"".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you
have to take.  ""High blood pressure"" - I have never heard of this claim
before.  ""... anabolic steroids"" - I have also never heard of this claim
before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth
for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?

I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely
to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component
of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an
important contribution to good health.  It is important to
exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).

Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase
lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the
statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.

Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of
the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role
in ""sensitizing"" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.
Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity
to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose
weight (4).

Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards
protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This ""protein sparing""
effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets
as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle
and organ tissue.  By ""sensitizing"" muscle to insulin,
chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters
so that they ""burn"" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation
of lean body mass has an important long-term positive
effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the
fat they've lost.

Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding
the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.
Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability
of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin 
stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say
that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.

In summary, you need to change your life style in order to
loose weight and stay healthy:

  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.
     - Eating fat makes you fat.

  B. Increase dietary fiber
     - low in calories; high in nutrients.

  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week
     - burn calories.

  D. Take chromium picolinate daily
     - lose fat; keep muscle

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater
can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are
potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall
correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which
is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic
glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.

As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams
of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably
cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.

About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax, probably as a

1. Inject olive oil into ears.
2. Prevent leakage of oil with cotton.
3. Come back in an hour.

Interesting. What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination? None of the

   Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
   status of his research would be appreciated.

Burzynski's work is not too promising. None of his A-1 through A-5
antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against
experimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against
leukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce
toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth
of the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)

Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1
and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been
extracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually
distinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10
against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines
from tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and
small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous
system, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited
neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.

It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski's
theory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to
PAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying
peptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for
antineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1
mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a
chemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically
extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are
habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects
of thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10
does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce
teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.

Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, early
research, past and present support by others for his work have been
shown to be untrue.

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).

You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the
Classic Example, but there are probably others.

Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By
looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.

The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:

1: How does it work?

2: What evidence is there?

The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on
reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.
(Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner.)

The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done
and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.

The word ""licensed"" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by
whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove
and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means ""(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist"".

BTW, the usual term is ""herbalist"".  Why use a different word?

See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information.

I am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats.

It is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should
avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before
preparing or eating meals.  The latter is sound advice at any time of
course.

Apart from that, its no great problem.  You certainly do not need to
get rid of your cats.

I beg to differ.  Chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease

I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery,
and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage
is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular
or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners
who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique.

In the case of massage, there is a technique called ""deep abdominal massage""
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!
The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.

I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  The human intestine
is not a New York City sewer pipe!  And even if it were, you eat half of
a small box of Triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
inner surface of your intestine  :-)

That's fine.  These words have multiple meanings.

As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions
of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable.  Note that this is a
positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a
god; I do not believe in a god, but I also do not believe the
agnostic claim.

I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer I
couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps.

   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care
of them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year we
couldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?
Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else.

   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seem
to come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed in
them. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon
as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.

Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they
seem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about
wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,
and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd. So far only
two things seem to work: To kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows. 

NB: I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.

Precisely.  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing ""difficulty with his behavior"".  Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  One would want to
rule out the possibility that the ""bad behavior"" is not psychiatric
illness at all.

Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,
biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic
persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular
carcinoma.

Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of
a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It
consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting
plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast
to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, 
bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. 

CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and
CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed
out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing
areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe
it is a continuum. I don't know.

Mark, this is the most reasonable post that I've seen in Sci. Med. on the 
topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a 
very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving 
that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in 
pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better 
progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their 
techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation 
to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or 
better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just 
the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA 
editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove 
itself to the medical community.

I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which 
has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support 
nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, 
that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and 
manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing 
only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs 
during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a 
better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being 
worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body, 
he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his 
students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17.
Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he 
used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic 
Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to 
speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little 
understanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.

I am reluctant to summarize it, for then you will have my opinion of what the

for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article.  The
title is ""The shot doctors"" and it appears on Pages 96-100 of the February,
1988 issue of Consumer Reports.  The following excerpt from the article may
entice you to read the whole article:

Cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population.  From the responses
I've received to that post (all from men, by the way) I get the impression
that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the
need or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex.

With tv programs about ""boobs"" (Seinfeld) and ""masturbation (again Seinfeld)
and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage
pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States, I would
not assume that we American's are frightened of sex.  Rather we are a bit
stupid about it.  Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or
promiscuity.  It requires responsibility.

Nice explanation except that it isn't N-hydroxylation that causes the
formation of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), but rather a
direct two-electron oxidation. In addition, there is one school of thought
that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein
is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.  

As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one
of the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topic
can be found in: 

	Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. 	
	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its
	Mechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367-
	407 (1992).

	(Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe)

I couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic
dose of acetaminophen causes.  I've heard a number of descriptions by
physicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a
lingering very painful death.

     I posted about a ""pulse of (relaxation) electricity"".  I now think
it more like a pulse of ""relaxation"" or comfort than a pulse of
electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.

     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your
palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you
relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,
you feel a ""shiver"" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).
Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you
hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down
in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This
roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your
body.

     ""Shiver"" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake.
What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body
experience?

Hello all,

My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring 
antidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these. 
So far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with 
different but unbearable side effects.

The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to 
sit still for more than a minute or so.

The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the 
body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded 
over.

The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- 
ordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was 
""closed down"".

Has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next 
step?

Thankyou in advance.

biopsy in the first place?  My understanding (and feel free to correct me)
is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated, with overall normal
hepatic function.  I would think that the only clue might be a history of
prior HepB infection and a positive HepB-sAg.  Or is it indeed on a
continuum with CAH, and the distinction merely one of pathology and
prognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features?

I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no
anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe
because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a
20mg dose didn't work.

Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. 
Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm
having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the
Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.

My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many
side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work
at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.

>...suggestions as to the next step?

Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much
experience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe
him.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioner's office.

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor; what I know about this comes from talking to
my psychiatrist and reading sci.med.

Zoloft is a stimulating antidepressant.

It is unfortunate that antidepressant therapy is trial and error, but
if it is any help, there are a lot of people using the side effects of
the many medications to help manage other conditions.

Insomnia is a known, but relatively infrequent, side-effect of
diphenhydramine.  

For most people, this does not occur.  On the other hand, most people
can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use.
(Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to
another to avoid this.)

It may be a good way to catch a cold.  It's easy to pick up cold
viruses on your fingers, either from touching a contaminated surface,
or by shaking hands with someone that has a cold.  Then putting your
fingers in your nose will transfer the viruses to your nose.

Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver
biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months
after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have
persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of
elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times
normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. 
As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. 
Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at
least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of
a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with
CAH needs to be treated.

Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we
are beginning to wonder how often ""more often"" really is, whether our
son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the
longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are,
and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day
care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether
we should think about getting a nanny.

Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?
How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on
home care vs. day care?

-- Does being sick ""build immunity"" (leading to less illness later),
does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it
not have any long term effect?

-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and
that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the
greater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate
and PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is
associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its
size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the
effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she
asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when
exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. 

So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart
patients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial
aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).

> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.

> -- Does being sick ""build immunity"" (leading to less illness later),

> not have any long term effect?

Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.

> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
> term effects?

Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).
 
> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
> normal, and what does one do about it?

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my 
opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection.

> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, 
vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune 
response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's 
what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however.

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could
it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these
interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't
find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their
survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna-
tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find-
ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.

I've seen children do this and wondered about something.  If the
mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the
airway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might
it have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne
diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus, the body might generate
antibodies for this small ""invasion""?

Maybe this is why some children don't get sick very often? :-)

Sounds pretty familiar.  I posted similar cries about last September when
Caroline just entered daycare.  She was two, then, and have been with 
continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds
slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds.
Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she

There are the 'net studies' -- that is, if you read this newsgroup often,
there will be a round of questions like this every month.  There might
be formal studies like that, but bear with my not so academic experience.
Okay?

Gee, I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories.

I am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less.  But, that child 
still will face the world one day.

That's what I believe and comfort myself with.  Caroline will get more
and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other 
kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily.
However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these
diseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold,
we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp 
at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).
That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her
off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would
have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she
fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if
the child is in pain and/or high fever. 

>does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it
>not have any long term effect?

If the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime,
then the child should be stronger.

I'll leave this to expert.

If your child just entered daycare, I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be
the hardest.  (Then, you get more used to it.  Boy, do I hate to see me typing
this sentence.  I recall when I read something like this last September, I said 
to myself, 'oh, sure.'  But, I do get used to it, now.)  However, I do hear 
people say that it does get better after a year or two.  I am looking forward 
to a healthier next winter.  As it gets warmer, I hope you do get some break 
soon.

>-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?

Eat well, sleep well.  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary.

Good luck.

That is the standard advice in dermatology texts.
The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  Don't bother unless
it doesn't work otherwise.

Exactly, but it adds to the ""ritual"" aspect, which is important for
us suggestible patients.  (Posters, don't bother to repeat the 
rationale for the soak.)

>If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick

Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is 
famous for that.  One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin
cream is, the more effective.  

>Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'
>lotion.

Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  USP
lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more
expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  As I've commented before, petrolatum
is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close,
even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  Don't panic, but
also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin.

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I
thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  

The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.
The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point
the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear
to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then
pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.
It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on 
yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,
and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  

I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,
and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give
me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion
feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly
on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to
the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company
had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end
of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior
to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree
of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.

I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the
probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you
have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button
to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect
that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for
yet another reason.

In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe
it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

I had ankle reconstruction (grafting the extensor digitorum
longus to the lateral side of the ankle, along with a video
arthroscopy of the ankle (interesting to watch, to say the
least). Since then, I have had periodic muscle spasms (not
cramping, but twitching that is very fast) in some of the
muscle groups along the lateral side, and along the top of
my foot. 

TX with quinine sulfate produced ringing in my ears, but did
help with the spasms.

I am on flexeril now, but no discernable help with the spasms.

Any ideas?

One thing - I am in a short leg cast, so heat is not the answer.

I've had three children and the pain was different in degree for each.  I
think it just depends.  I was impressed by how awful a kidney stone seemed
to be, when I saw a relative with one.  I bet they depend, too--some are
probably worse than others.

Pain--yucch.

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
(type II, I guess--no insulin). 


I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain. 

For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
interest, like bread on the waters.


With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.

Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.

Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk (""It's strep;
give him this and he'll get well."") and so my expectations are too high?

Last week I went to see a gastroenterologist. I had never met this
doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I
arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.
They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the
doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first
time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but
on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him
with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there
for and took a history, all before I undressed.
 
Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor
for the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on
something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an
identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If
nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self
conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare
bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.
 
Does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk
attitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusual?

I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems
that indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas
there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral,
drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of
""thresholds"" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally, I think
that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and
normal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the
potential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thus
providing these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see if
anyone's done any decision analysis on this.
